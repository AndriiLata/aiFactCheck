  1. Andy_Fletcher_(musician) → abstract → Andrew John Fletcher (8 July 1961 – 26 May 2022), also known as Fletch, was an English keyboard player and founding member of the electronic band Depeche Mode. In 2020, he and the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

  1. Depeche_Mode → formerBandMember → Andy_Fletcher_(musician)

[Path 3]
  1. Andy_Fletcher_(musician) → pastMemberOf → Depeche_Mode";The evidence clearly refutes the claim that Andy Fletcher joined Depeche Mode a decade after its founding. The snippets indicate that Andy Fletcher was a founding member of Depeche Mode, which means he was part of the band from its inception. Therefore, the claim is incorrect, as it contradicts the established fact that he was involved with the band from the very beginning. The evidence is sufficient to support this conclusion.;;

  1. Alphabet_Inc. → abstract → Alphabet Inc. is an American multinational technology conglomerate holding company headquartered in Mountain View, California. It was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015, and became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries. Alphabet is the world's third-largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft. The establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business ""cleaner and more accountable"" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019, with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai, also the CEO of Google. Page and Brin remain employees, board members, and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc.

[Path 3]
  1. Makani_(company) → parent → Alphabet_Inc.";"The evidence provided is sufficient to refute the claim that Alphabet is the parent company of GM, Apple, and Aquafina. 

1. The first snippet clearly states that Alphabet Inc. is a multinational technology conglomerate that became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries. It specifically mentions that Alphabet is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, which includes Apple, but it does not indicate that Alphabet is the parent company of Apple. 

2. The evidence does not mention GM (General Motors) or Aquafina (a brand of bottled water owned by PepsiCo) as subsidiaries or companies under Alphabet's ownership. 

3. The snippets focus on Alphabet's relationship with its own subsidiaries and do not support the claim that it has any ownership over GM or Aquafina.

Therefore, the claim is clearly refuted by the evidence, as it does not support the assertion that Alphabet is the parent company of the mentioned companies.";;

  1. Chris_Noth → abstract → Christopher David Noth (/noʊθ/ NOHTH; born November 13, 1954) is an American actor. He is known for his television roles as NYPD Detective Mike Logan on Law & Order (1990–95), Big on Sex and the City (1998–2004), and Peter Florrick on The Good Wife (2009–16). Noth reprised his role of Mike Logan on Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2005–08), and reprised his role of Big in the films Sex and the City (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010). He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for Sex and the City in 1999 and for The Good Wife in 2010. Noth starred in the first two seasons of the 2021 revival of The Equalizer, on CBS, and appeared in And Just Like That..., the revival of Sex and the City.

[Path 2]
  1. The_Good_Wife → abstract → The Good Wife is an American legal and political drama television series that aired on CBS from September 22, 2009, to May 8, 2016. It focuses on Alicia Florrick, the wife of the Cook County State's Attorney, who returns to her career in law after the events of a public sex and political corruption scandal involving her husband. The series was created by Robert and Michelle King and stars Julianna Margulies, Josh Charles, Christine Baranski, Matt Czuchry, Archie Panjabi, Zach Grenier, Matthew Goode, Cush Jumbo, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Alan Cumming, and features Chris Noth in a recurring role. The executive producers included the Kings, Ridley and Tony Scott, Charles McDougall, and David W. Zucker. The Good Wife is a serialized show featuring several story arcs that play out over multiple episodes, as well as stand-alone storylines that are concluded by the end of each episode. The serial plots—a rarity on CBS, a network where most of the programming at that time was procedural—were especially showcased in its highly praised fifth season. The Good Wife was acclaimed during its run and considered by several critics to be network television's ""last great drama"". It won numerous awards, including five Emmys and the 2014 Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. The performances of the show's cast have been particularly recognized, with Julianna Margulies, Archie Panjabi, Christine Baranski, and Josh Charles each receiving widespread acclaim. The show was also lauded for its insight on social media and the internet in society, politics, and law. It received recognition for producing full 22-episode seasons while other similarly acclaimed dramas often produce only 6 to 13 episodes per season. CBS announced on February 7, 2016, that the show was ending with its seventh season. The final episode aired on May 8, 2016. A spinoff titled The Good Fight, centered around Baranski's character Diane Lockhart and Cush Jumbo's Lucca Quinn, also starring Rose Leslie and Delroy Lindo, premiered in February 2017.

The first snippet explicitly states that he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for The Good Wife in 2010. This directly confirms the claim made. 

The other snippets provide additional context about Chris Noth's career and the show itself, but the key information needed to validate the claim is clearly present in the first piece of evidence. Therefore, the evidence clearly supports the claim.";;

From 2002 to 2003, he became a host for KBS's Music Bank."" This directly confirms that Jung Ji-hoon hosted the show during that time period, providing strong support for the claim.

However, these contradictions do not negate the fact that Jung Ji-hoon did host the show at one point in time.

In conclusion, while there are contradictions regarding the current and past hosts of ""Music Bank,"" the evidence clearly supports the claim that Jung Ji-hoon hosted the show from 2002 to 2003. Therefore, the claim is sufficiently supported.";;

For example, one snippet states, ""The Los Angeles Dodgers have donated to the following agencies to support fire relief efforts,"" which implies that other teams are active in this area, but Santos FC is not mentioned.

2. The evidence includes multiple contradictions regarding the involvement of Santos FC in fire relief donations. For instance, snippets with high confidence levels (e.g., 0.981 and 0.995) explicitly contradict the claim, indicating that Santos FC is not recognized as a donor for fire relief.

3. The neutral snippets do not provide any evidence of Santos FC's involvement in fire relief efforts either. They discuss general donations from other teams or organizations but do not mention Santos FC.

Overall, the evidence is sufficient to refute the claim that Santos FC is a fire relief donor, as it consistently points to the absence of any contributions from the club in this context.";;

  1. Dan_Aykroyd → abstract → Daniel Edward Aykroyd CM OOnt (/ˈækrɔɪd/ AK-royd; born July 1, 1952) is a Canadian actor, comedian, producer, musician and writer. He was an original member of the ""Not Ready for Prime Time Players"" on Saturday Night Live (1975–1979). During his tenure on SNL, Aykroyd appeared in a recurring series of sketches about the Coneheads, and the Blues Brothers. For his work on the show he received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations winning for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series in 1977. After his departure, he has since returned in guest roles. Aykroyd gained prominence for writing, and starring as Dr. Raymond ""Ray"" Stantz in Ghostbusters (1984), which spawned an entire media franchise, reprising the role in Ghostbusters II (1989), Casper (1995), Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021), and an upcoming sequel (2023), cameoing as a different character in Ghostbusters: Answer the Call (2016). He also is known for his comedic roles in Trading Places (1983), Spies Like Us (1985), Dragnet (1987), and Coneheads (1993), portraying Roman Craig in She's Having a Baby and The Great Outdoors (both 1988), and Elwood J. Blues in The Blues Brothers (1980) and Blues Brothers 2000 (1998). In 1990, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Driving Miss Daisy (1989). He continued his dramatic roles in My Girl (1991), Chaplin, and Sneakers (both 1992). Aykroyd has done supporting roles in Tommy Boy (1995), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), 50 First Dates (2004), The Campaign (2012), and Behind the Candelabra (2013). He starred as Reverend Mike Weber in his own sitcom, Soul Man (1997–1998). He has since appeared on various television shows including It's Garry Shandling's Show (1990), Home Improvement (1997), Family Guy (2009), The Simpsons (2021) and The Conners (2019). Aykroyd is also a businessman, having co-founded the House of Blues chain of music venues and the Crystal Head Vodka brand.

This directly supports the claim that Minos had a husband, as ""husband"" can refer to a male partner in a marital relationship, and in this context, it is understood that Minos is the male figure in the relationship with Pasiphaë. 

The first snippet provides background information about Minos, but it does not directly address the claim. However, the second snippet is clear and relevant, confirming the marital relationship. The third snippet mentions Merope as a daughter of Minos, which further supports the idea of Minos having a family, but it is the second snippet that directly confirms the claim.

17;Stone Temple Pilots had an original member that had the name Emile.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Stone_Temple_Pilots → abstract → Stone Temple Pilots (also known by the initialism STP) is an American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland (lead vocals), brothers Dean DeLeo (guitar) and Robert DeLeo (bass, backing vocals), and Eric Kretz (drums). The band's line-up remained unchanged from its formation in 1989 until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington joined the band in May 2013 but left amicably in November 2015. In 2016, the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist; they announced Jeff Gutt as the new lead singer on November 14, 2017. After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. The band's debut album, Core, released in 1992, was a major commercial success and STP went on to become one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, selling more than 18 million albums in the United States and 40 million worldwide. The band released four more studio albums: Purple (1994), Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop (1996), No. 4 (1999), and Shangri-La Dee Da (2001), before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). The band eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released their self-titled sixth album in 2010, and actively toured until Chester Bennington's departure. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013. STP has released two albums with Gutt on vocals: its second self-titled album on March 16, 2018 and eighth studio album Perdida on February 7, 2020. While initially rising to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova, and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

18;Nikola Tesla wrote on telecommunication technology.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Nikola_Tesla → abstract → Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла, pronounced [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed. Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it. After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

1. **Historical Context**: The snippets indicate that Tesla worked in telephony and was involved in the early electric power industry, which is closely related to telecommunications. His practical experience in these fields suggests a foundational knowledge that would inform his writings.

2. **Wireless Communication**: The evidence specifically mentions that in 1893, Tesla made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. This directly relates to telecommunication technology, as wireless communication is a fundamental aspect of the field.

3. **Wardenclyffe Tower Project**: The mention of Tesla's unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, which aimed to be an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, further emphasizes his involvement and writings on telecommunication technology.

4. **Autobiography**: The reference to Tesla's autobiography, ""My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla,"" suggests that he documented his thoughts and inventions, which would likely include his ideas on telecommunication.

Overall, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim that Nikola Tesla wrote on telecommunication technology, as it highlights his contributions, experiments, and theoretical ideas in this area.";;

  1. Billy_Wilder → abstract → Billy Wilder (/ˈwaɪldər/; German: [ˈvɪldɐ]; born Samuel Wilder; June 22, 1906 – March 27, 2002) was an Austrian-American filmmaker. His career in Hollywood spanned five decades, and he is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of Classic Hollywood cinema. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director eight times, winning twice, and for a screenplay Academy Award 13 times, winning three times. Wilder became a screenwriter while living in Berlin. The rise of the Nazi Party and antisemitism in Germany saw him move to Paris. He then moved to Hollywood in 1933, and had a major hit when he, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-nominated film Ninotchka (1939). Wilder established his directorial reputation and received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director with the film noir adaptation of the novel Double Indemnity (1944), for which he co-wrote the screenplay with Raymond Chandler. Wilder won the Best Director and Best Screenplay Academy Awards for the film adaptation of the novel The Lost Weekend (1945), which also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the 1950s, Wilder directed and co-wrote a string of critically acclaimed films, including the Hollywood drama Sunset Boulevard (1950), for which he won his second screenplay Academy Award, Ace in the Hole (1951), Stalag 17 (1953) and Sabrina (1954). Wilder directed and co-wrote three films in 1957, including The Spirit of St. Louis, Love in the Afternoon and Witness for the Prosecution. Wilder directed Marilyn Monroe in two films, The Seven Year Itch (1955) and Some Like It Hot (1959). In 1960, Wilder co-wrote, directed and produced the critically acclaimed film The Apartment. It won Wilder Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Beginning with Some Like It Hot and The Apartment, he made seven films with Jack Lemmon, four of which co-starred Walter Matthau; the threesome's first collaboration was The Fortune Cookie (1966). Other notable films Wilder directed include One, Two, Three (1961), Irma la Douce (1963), Kiss Me, Stupid (1964) and Avanti! (1972). Wilder directed fourteen actors in Oscar-nominated performances. Wilder received various honors over his distinguished career between the late 1980s and 1990s. He received the British Academy Film Award Fellowship Award, the Directors Guild of America's Lifetime Achievement Award, the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement, and the Producers Guild of America's Lifetime Achievement Award. Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, Some Like It Hot, and The Apartment are included in the AFI's greatest American films of all time. As of 2019, seven of his films are preserved in the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"".

... (49 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence is insufficient to clearly support or refute the claim that Mr. Nobody had a best-selling soundtrack by Pierre Van Dormael. 

While the evidence confirms that Pierre Van Dormael composed the soundtrack for the film ""Mr. Nobody,"" it does not provide any definitive information regarding its sales status or whether it was a best-seller. Several snippets mention the soundtrack and its release, but they do not indicate that it achieved best-selling status. 

Additionally, there are multiple contradictions in the evidence regarding the best-selling soundtracks of all time, with references to other soundtracks like ""The Bodyguard"" being noted as the best-selling soundtrack. This suggests that the claim about ""Mr. Nobody"" being a best-selling soundtrack is likely incorrect, but the evidence does not provide a clear conclusion either way. 

In summary, the evidence does not sufficiently support the claim, and the contradictions regarding best-selling soundtracks further complicate the matter.";;
21;Thailand is a constitutional monarchy that formed in 1603.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Thailand → abstract → Thailand (/ˈtaɪlænd, ˈtaɪlənd/ TY-land, TY-lənd), historically known as Siam (/saɪˈæm, ˈsaɪæm/) and officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia, located at the centre of the Indochinese Peninsula, spanning 513,120 square kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million. The country is bordered to the north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and the extremity of Myanmar. Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to the southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city. Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century. Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a regional power by the end of the 15th century. Ayutthaya reached its peak during the 18th century, until it was destroyed in the Burmese–Siamese War. Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. He was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty. Throughout the era of Western imperialism in Asia, Siam remained the only nation in the region to avoid colonization by foreign powers, although it was often forced to cede territory, trade and legal concessions in unequal treaties. The Siamese system of government was centralised and transformed into a modern unitary absolute monarchy in the reign of Chulalongkorn. In World War I, Siam sided with the Allies, a political decision made in order to amend the unequal treaties. Following a bloodless revolution in 1932, it became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to Thailand, becoming an ally of Japan in World War II. In the late 1950s, a military coup under Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a major ally of the United States, and played an anti-communist role in the region as a member of the failed SEATO, but from 1975 sought to improve relations with Communist China and Thailand's neighbours. Apart from a brief period of parliamentary democracy in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. Since the 2000s the country has been caught in continual bitter political conflict between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, which resulted in two coups (in 2006 and 2014), along with the establishment of its current constitution, a nominally democratic government after the 2019 Thai general election, and large pro-democracy protests in 2020–2021 which included unprecedented demands to reform the monarchy. Since 2019, it has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy; in practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold on power. Thailand is a middle power in global affairs and a founding member of ASEAN, and ranks very high in the Human Development Index. It has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia and the 22nd-largest in the world by PPP. Thailand is classified as a newly industrialised economy, with manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism as leading sectors.

[Path 3]
  1. Thailand → governmentType → Constitutional_monarchy";"The evidence provided is sufficient to refute the claim that Thailand is a constitutional monarchy that formed in 1603. 

1. **Constitutional Monarchy**: The evidence confirms that Thailand is indeed a constitutional monarchy, particularly noting that it became one following a bloodless revolution in 1932. This directly supports the aspect of the claim regarding its current form of government.

2. **Formation Date**: However, the claim that Thailand (or Siam) formed as a constitutional monarchy in 1603 is incorrect. The historical context provided indicates that the modern constitutional monarchy was established in 1932, not in 1603. Prior to that, Thailand was an absolute monarchy, and the significant political changes that led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy occurred much later.

In summary, while the evidence supports the claim that Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, it clearly refutes the assertion that this form of government was established in 1603. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.";;

Manson's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in California, over a period of five weeks in the summer of 1969. Known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz or Sexy Sadie, Atkins was convicted for her participation in eight of these killings, including the most notorious, the Tate murders in 1969. She was sentenced to death, which was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment when the California Supreme Court invalidated all death sentences issued prior to 1972. Atkins was incarcerated until her death in 2009. At the time of her death, she was California's longest-serving female inmate, long since surpassed by her fellow murderous Manson family members Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel.

1. Several snippets explicitly state that Hitler was a high school dropout and mention his attendance at the Realschule in Linz, indicating that he did not complete his education there. For example, one source states, ""Adolf Hitler was a high school dropout. He went to the high school Realschule in Linz ... He dropped out of school after ..."" (confidence: 0.997).

3. The evidence also includes details about the timeline of his education, indicating that he dropped out around the age of 16, which aligns with the historical accounts of his life.

While there are some contradictory snippets regarding the specifics of his schooling and the timeline, the overwhelming majority of the evidence supports the claim that he dropped out of school in Linz. Therefore, the evidence is sufficient to confirm the claim.";;

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that ""All the Lovers was a commercial success in film"" is insufficient to clearly support or refute the claim. 

1. **Mixed Evidence**: The evidence includes snippets that mention commercial success in relation to different films titled ""The Lovers"" or ""All the Lovers,"" but they do not consistently refer to the same film. For example, some snippets refer to ""Les Amants"" (1958) and others to different films or songs with similar titles. This creates ambiguity about which specific film is being discussed.

2. **Contradictory Information**: There are several snippets that contradict the claim, stating that certain films were not commercial successes. For instance, one snippet explicitly states that a film was ""not a commercial success"" and is considered a ""flop."" This contradiction further complicates the ability to ascertain the commercial success of ""All the Lovers.""

3. **Neutral Statements**: Many snippets provide neutral information that does not directly address the claim, such as discussing the film's reception or box office performance without definitive conclusions about its commercial success.

In summary, the evidence does not provide a clear consensus on the commercial success of ""All the Lovers,"" leading to the conclusion that it is insufficient to support or refute the claim definitively.";;

For instance, snippets mention Anderson directing Phoenix in ""The Master"" and their ongoing collaboration, indicating a working relationship.

  1. Jim_Henson → abstract → James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936 – May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, animator, cartoonist, actor, inventor, and filmmaker who achieved worldwide notice as the creator of The Muppets and Fraggle Rock (1983–1987) and director of The Dark Crystal (1982) and Labyrinth (1986). He was born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in both Leland, Mississippi and University Park, Maryland. Henson began developing puppets in high school. He created Sam and Friends (1955–1961), a short-form comedy television program, while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park in collaboration with Jane Nebel who was a senior. A few years later the two married. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics, after which he and Jane produced coffee advertisements and developed experimental films. In 1958, he co-founded Muppets, Inc. with Jane, which became The Jim Henson Company. In 1969, Henson joined the children's educational television program Sesame Street (1969–present) where he helped to develop Muppet characters for the series. He and his creative team also appeared on the first season of the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (1975–present). He produced The Muppet Show (1976–1981) during this period. He won fame for his characters, particularly Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog and Ernie. During the later years of his life, he founded the Jim Henson Foundation and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. He won the Emmy Award twice for his involvement in The StoryTeller (1987–1988) and The Jim Henson Hour (1989). On May 16, 1990, Henson died in New York City at age 53 from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. He posthumously received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and was named a Disney Legend in 2011.

Instead, it describes him as a puppeteer, animator, cartoonist, actor, inventor, and filmmaker, highlighting his creative contributions to television and film, particularly through The Muppets and other projects. 

While Henson co-founded The Jim Henson Company, which may involve aspects of production and creation, the term ""manufacturer"" typically refers to someone who produces goods on a large scale, often in a factory setting. The evidence does not indicate that Henson was involved in manufacturing in this sense. Instead, it emphasizes his roles in creative and artistic endeavors rather than industrial production.

Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to support the claim that Jim Henson was a manufacturer. It does not provide any information about him engaging in manufacturing activities or producing goods in a traditional manufacturing context.";;

  1. Andrew_Wood_(singer) → abstract → Andrew Patrick Wood (January 8, 1966 – March 19, 1990) was an American musician. He was the lead singer and lyricist for the alternative rock bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. Wood formed Malfunkshun in 1980 with his older brother Kevin Wood on guitar and Regan Hagar on drums. The band used alter ego personas onstage, with Wood using the name Landrew the Love Child. Though the band only had two songs released, ""With Yo' Heart (Not Yo' Hands)"" and ""Stars-n-You"", on the Deep Six compilation album, they are often cited as being among the ""founding fathers"" of the Seattle grunge movement. During his time in Malfunkshun, Wood started relying heavily on drugs, entering rehab in 1985. By 1988, Malfunkshun had disbanded and Wood began jamming with Green River members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament. They soon began writing original material and formed Mother Love Bone the same year, adding guitarist Bruce Fairweather (also a former member of Green River) and drummer Greg Gilmore to the lineup. The following year, the band signed a deal with PolyGram, issuing a six-song EP, Shine, before going on tour, supporting The Dogs D'Amour. Towards the end of the year, the band recorded their debut album, Apple, which was scheduled for release in 1990. Due to his struggle with drug addiction, Wood checked himself into rehab in 1989, hoping to get clean for the release of Mother Love Bone's debut album. He died in Seattle on March 19, 1990 at the age of 24, after being found in a comatose state by his girlfriend following a heroin overdose.

This indicates that he collaborated with musicians from another band (Green River) to create a new band (Mother Love Bone).

2. The snippets confirm that Wood was involved in both Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone, and they detail his transition from one band to another, highlighting his connections with other musicians.

[Path 2]
  1. Everton_F.C. → abstract → Everton Football Club (/ˈɛvərtən/) is an English professional association football club based in Liverpool that competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club was a founder member of the Football League in 1888 and has competed in the top division for a record 119 seasons, having missed only four top-flight seasons (1930–31, 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1953–54). Everton is the second-longest continuous serving club in English top flight football and ranks third in the all-time points rankings. The club has won nine league titles, five FA Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and nine Charity Shields. Formed in 1878, Everton won their first League Championship during the 1890–91 season. After winning four more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-World War II lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League championships, one FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup. The club's supporters are colloquially known as ""Evertonians"" or ""Blues"". Everton's main rivals are Liverpool, whose home stadium at Anfield is just under one mile away from Everton's home at Goodison Park; the two clubs contest the Merseyside derby. Everton have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, having moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement over its rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.

The snippets from DBpedia do not explicitly mention any matches played by Everton at Wembley Stadium. While the information discusses Everton's history, achievements, and their home stadium (Goodison Park), it does not provide specific details about their participation in matches at Wembley.

To determine the validity of the claim, one would need direct evidence indicating whether Everton has played at Wembley Stadium, such as records of specific matches or tournaments (e.g., FA Cup finals) that took place at Wembley involving Everton. Since this evidence is not present in the snippets provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether the claim is true or false.";;

Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film stars Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo. The film's plot is loosely based on the events surrounding multimillionaire E.I. du Pont family heir and wrestling enthusiast John du Pont's 1986 recruitment of two 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist wrestlers, Mark Schultz and his older brother David, to help coach U.S. wrestlers for participation in national, world, and Olympic competition, and the subsequent murder of David Schultz by du Pont in January 1996. Foxcatcher received critical acclaim for the three lead actors' performances, Miller's direction, and the film's visual style and tone. It was nominated for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, where Miller won the Best Director Award. The film had three Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for Carell, and Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for Ruffalo. The film was nominated for five Oscars at the 2015 Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Carell, Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo and Best Director for Miller. It became the first film to be nominated for Best Director but not Best Picture since 2008, when Julian Schnabel was nominated for The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, two years before the Academy extended its maximum number of Best Picture nominees to 10 films.

Specifically, the evidence states that the film received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globe Awards for Mark Ruffalo, as well as a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards. 

The key points from the evidence include:
1. ""Foxcatcher"" was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo.
2. The film was also nominated for five Oscars at the 2015 Academy Awards, which included a nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo.

Thus, the claim is clearly supported by the evidence, as it confirms the nominations for Best Supporting Actor in both the Golden Globe and Academy Awards contexts.";;

39;Rafael Nadal has won Glam Slam doubles titles.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Rafael_Nadal → abstract → Rafael Nadal Parera (Catalan: [rəf(ə)ˈɛl nəˈðal pəˈɾeɾə], Spanish: [rafaˈel naˈðal paˈɾeɾa]; born 3 June 1986) is a Spanish professional tennis player. He is currently ranked world No. 2 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). He has been ranked world No. 1 for 209 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won an all-time record 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles. His 81 consecutive wins on clay is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era. For over a decade, Nadal has dominated men's tennis along with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the Big Three, collectively considered by some to be the three most successful male tennis players of all time. At the start of his professional career, Nadal became one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching the world No. 2 ranking and winning 16 titles before turning 20, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final, his first major victory off clay. He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, then-24-year-old Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam). After two injury-plagued seasons, Nadal made a stellar return in one of the greatest comeback seasons of all time in 2013; reaching 14 finals, winning two majors and five Masters events including the US Open Series sweep (Summer Slam). He continued his dominance at the French Open, securing six titles, two US Open titles, an Australian Open title, and an Olympic doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics with Marc López. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and Federer for the most major men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles. He has appeared in the Top 10 of the ATP rankings continuously since April 2005. As a vigorous left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths is his forehand, which he hits with extremely heavy topspin at difficult angles. He is one of the best at breaking serve, regularly appearing among the tour leaders in percentage of return games, return points, and break points won. Nadal has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times, and was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021. He is also a recipient of the Grand Cross of the Order of Dos De Mayo, the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, and the Medal of the City of Paris. Representing Spain, he has won two Olympic gold medals, and led the nation to five Davis Cup titles. Nadal has also opened a tennis academy in Mallorca, and is an active philanthropist.

41;Athena is an alien.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Athena → abstract → Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, warfare, and handicraft who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens is dedicated to her. Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. In art, she is generally depicted wearing a helmet and holding a spear. From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as Polias and Poliouchos (both derived from polis, meaning ""city-state""), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified acropolis in the central part of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as Ergane. She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as Athena Promachos. Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar. In Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the forehead of her father Zeus. In some versions of the story, Athena has no mother and is born from Zeus' forehead by parthenogenesis. In others, such as Hesiod's Theogony, Zeus swallows his consort Metis, who was pregnant with Athena; in this version, Athena is first born within Zeus and then escapes from his body through his forehead. In the founding myth of Athens, Athena bested Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. She was known as Athena Parthenos ""Athena the Virgin,"" but in one archaic Attic myth, the god Hephaestus tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius, an important Athenian founding hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have aided the heroes Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War. She plays an active role in the Iliad, in which she assists the Achaeans and, in the Odyssey, she is the divine counselor to Odysseus. In the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, afterward transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.

For example, one snippet states, ""Assassin's Creed was released in the US the week of December 20 and will see a theatrical release in Brazil, South Korea and Sweden later this...""

Other snippets mention trailers and promotional content related to the film but do not confirm a theatrical release in Russia.

After studying improv at Chicago's Second City and ImprovOlympic in the early 1990s, Poehler co-founded the improvisational-comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade.

Along with other members of the comedy group, Poehler is a founder of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. In 2001, Poehler joined the cast of the NBC sketch-comedy show Saturday Night Live.

46;Amelia Earhart was from Pennsylvania.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Amelia_Earhart → abstract → Amelia Mary Earhart (/ˈɛərhɑːrt/ AIR-hart, born July 24, 1897; disappeared July 2, 1937; declared dead January 5, 1939) was an American aviation pioneer and writer. Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She set many other records, was one of the first aviators to promote commercial air travel, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences, and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots. Born and raised in Atchison, Kansas, and later in Des Moines, Iowa, Earhart developed a passion for adventure at a young age, steadily gaining flying experience from her twenties. In 1928, Earhart became the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane (accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz), for which she achieved celebrity status. In 1932, piloting a Lockheed Vega 5B, Earhart made a nonstop solo transatlantic flight, becoming the first woman to achieve such a feat. She received the United States Distinguished Flying Cross for this accomplishment. In 1935, Earhart became a visiting faculty member at Purdue University as an advisor to aeronautical engineering and a career counselor to female students. She was also a member of the National Woman's Party and an early supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. Known as one of the most inspirational American figures in aviation from the late 1920s throughout the 1930s, Earhart's legacy is often compared to the early aeronautical career of pioneer aviator Charles Lindbergh, as well as to figures like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt for their close friendship and lasting impact on the issue of women's causes from that period. During an attempt at becoming the first woman to complete a circumnavigational flight of the globe in 1937 in a Purdue-funded Lockheed Model 10-E Electra, Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the central Pacific Ocean near Howland Island. The two were last seen in Lae, New Guinea, on July 2, 1937, on the last land stop before Howland Island and one of their final legs of the flight. She presumably died in the Pacific during the circumnavigation, just three weeks prior to her fortieth birthday. Nearly one year and six months after she and Noonan disappeared, Earhart was officially declared dead. Investigations and significant public interest in their disappearance still continue over 80 years later. Decades after her presumed death, Earhart was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1968 and the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1973. She now has several commemorative memorials named in her honor around the United States, including an urban park, an airport, a residence hall, a museum, a research foundation, a bridge, a cargo ship, an earth-fill dam, four schools, a hotel, a playhouse, a library, multiple roads, and more. She also has a minor planet, planetary corona, and newly-discovered lunar crater named after her. She is ranked ninth on Flying's list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.

1. **Supportive Evidence**: Several snippets indicate that U2 has sold more than 170 million records worldwide, with some sources stating figures like ""over 175 million"" and ""more than 170 million."" This suggests that the claim could be accurate.

2. **Contradictory Evidence**: However, there are also multiple snippets that contradict this claim, stating lower figures such as ""over 120 million"" and ""between 150 - 170 million."" This indicates that there is uncertainty about the exact number of records sold.

3. **Neutral Evidence**: Many snippets provide neutral information about U2's sales without confirming or denying the specific claim, which adds to the ambiguity.

Overall, while there is some evidence that supports the claim, the presence of contradictory information and the lack of a definitive consensus on the exact number of records sold means that the evidence is insufficient to conclusively support or refute the claim.";;

[Path 3]
  1. Star_Wars → abstract → Star Wars is an American epic space opera multimedia franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019). All nine films of the ""Skywalker Saga"" were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action ""anthology"" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time. Additional upcoming films are in the works, including an untitled movie from Taika Waititi and Rogue Squadron directed by Patty Jenkins, both currently without release dates.";"The evidence provided does not clearly support or refute the claim that ""Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones features scenes involving DVDs."" The snippets retrieved from DBpedia primarily provide general information about the Star Wars franchise and its films, but they do not specifically mention DVDs or any scenes from ""Attack of the Clones"" that involve DVDs.

Since the evidence does not directly address the claim and lacks specific references to scenes or content related to DVDs in the film, it is insufficient to determine the validity of the claim. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the claim is true or false based on the available evidence.";;

[Path 2]
  1. Xbox_One → abstract → The Xbox One is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to Xbox 360 and the third base console in the Xbox series of video game consoles. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013 and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. Microsoft marketed the device as an ""all-in-one entertainment system"", hence the name ""Xbox One"". An eighth-generation console, it mainly competed against Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and later the Switch. Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC-based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built around the x86-64 instruction set. Xbox One's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D-pad, and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing, as well as social networking features and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay or livestream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices. The console can play Blu-ray Disc, and overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide. The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the ""Kinect 2.0"", providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition. The Xbox One received positive reviews for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor at launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console's software post-launch received a positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands. The original Xbox One model was succeeded by the in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for HDR10 high-dynamic-range video, as well as support for 4K video playback and upscaling of games from 1080p to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, named , was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November; it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. The system was succeeded by the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, which launched on November 10, 2020. Production of all Xbox One consoles ceased at the end of that year.

However, there is no evidence provided that indicates she appeared in a TV show specifically written by Will Fetters. The references to her involvement are all related to the film, not television.

... (61 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that Ludacris's album contained the thematic sounds of his other records is insufficient. 

Here's why:

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Several pieces of evidence indicate a contradiction to the claim. For instance, one snippet states that ""This album showed Ludacris in a new light, experimenting with sounds and themes that pushed the boundaries of what fans expected,"" suggesting that the album diverges from his previous works rather than aligning with them. Another snippet mentions that ""every one of Ludacris' four follow-up albums... abandon that seamless banger-parade setup,"" which implies a departure from his earlier thematic sounds.

2. **Neutral Evidence**: Many snippets are classified as neutral, meaning they do not provide clear support or refutation of the claim. They discuss various aspects of Ludacris's albums without directly addressing the thematic continuity or divergence between them.

3. **Entailment Evidence**: There is some evidence that could be interpreted as supporting the claim, but it is not definitive. For example, one snippet mentions that ""Ludacris breaks down his most iconic tracks,"" which could imply a connection to his previous works, but it does not explicitly confirm that the thematic sounds are consistent across albums.

Overall, the presence of contradictory evidence and the lack of strong, clear support for the claim indicate that the evidence is insufficient to definitively support or refute the claim about Ludacris's album containing the thematic sounds of his other records.";;

  1. Judith_Quiney → abstract → Judith Quiney (baptised 2 February 1585 – 9 February 1662), née Shakespeare, was the younger daughter of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway and the fraternal twin of their only son Hamnet Shakespeare. She married Thomas Quiney, a vintner of Stratford-upon-Avon. The circumstances of the marriage, including Quiney's misconduct, may have prompted the rewriting of Shakespeare's will. Thomas was struck out, while Judith's inheritance was attached with provisions to safeguard it from her husband. The bulk of Shakespeare's estate was left, in an elaborate fee tail, to his elder daughter Susanna and her male heirs. Judith and Thomas Quiney had three children. By the time of Judith Quiney's death, she had outlived her children by many years. She has been depicted in several works of fiction as part of an attempt to piece together unknown portions of her father's life.

1. The first snippet provides a comprehensive overview of Judith Quiney's life, confirming her death date as February 9, 1662, and mentions her background as the daughter of William Shakespeare.
2. The second snippet explicitly states the year of her death as 1662.
3. The third snippet confirms the exact date of her death as February 9, 1662.

He runs four active YouTube channels, all named after him. His main channel is dedicated to vlogging, while the second features video gaming content. The third is for daily vlogs, and the fourth is a react channel. His channels have a combined total of more than 2.9 billion views. He was a contestant on the 22nd and 24th seasons of The Amazing Race, and has appeared in a handful of short films as well as creating and hosting Escape the Night, an unscripted, unrehearsed web series, distributed by YouTube via its paid-subscription service YouTube Premium. He appears in all four of the seasons with several other YouTubers, including Liza Koshy, Shane Dawson, Colleen Ballinger, and Rosanna Pansino.

Therefore, the claim is refuted by the evidence, as it categorically describes Graceffa's professional identity outside of politics.;;
57;Swedish Empire was ruled by Gustavus Adolphus before he died in 1633.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Gustavus_Adolphus → abstract → Gustavus Adolphus (9 December [N.S 19 December] 1594 – 6 November [N.S 16 November] 1632), also known in English as Gustav II Adolf or Gustav II Adolph, was King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632, and is credited for the rise of Sweden as a great European power (Swedish: Stormaktstiden). During his reign, Sweden became one of the primary military forces in Europe during the Thirty Years' War, helping to determine the political and religious balance of power in Europe. He was formally and posthumously given the name Gustavus Adolphus the Great (Swedish: Gustav Adolf den store; Latin: Gustavus Adolphus Magnus) by the Riksdag of the Estates in 1634. He is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in modern history, with use of an early form of combined arms. His most notable military victory was the Battle of Breitenfeld in 1631. With his resources, logistics, and support, Gustavus Adolphus was positioned to become a major European leader, but he was killed a year later at the Battle of Lützen. He was assisted in his efforts by Count Axel Oxenstierna, the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, who also acted as regent after his death. Coming to the throne at the age of 16, Gustavus Adolphus inherited three wars from his father Charles IX of Sweden; border conflicts with Russia and Denmark-Norway, and a dynastic struggle with his first cousin, King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland. Of these, the Danish war was the most serious. During his reign, Sweden rose from the status of a Baltic Sea basin regional power to one of the great powers of Europe and a model of early modern era government. Gustavus Adolphus is known as the ""father of modern warfare"", or the first modern general. He taught a number of other military commanders, such as Lennart Torstensson, who would go on to expand the boundaries and the power of Swedish Empire after Gustavus Adolphus's death. Spoils meant he became a successful bookraider in Europe, targeting Jesuit collections. His contributions to Sweden's rise in power included reformation of the administrative structure. For example, he began Parish Registration of the population, so that the central government could more efficiently tax and conscript the people. He is also widely commemorated by Protestants in Europe as the main defender of their cause during the Thirty Years' War, with multiple churches, foundations and other undertakings named after him, including the Gustav-Adolf-Werk.

[Path 2]
  1. Swedish_Empire → abstract → The Swedish Empire was a European great power that exercised territorial control over much of the Baltic region during the 17th and early 18th centuries (Swedish: Stormaktstiden, ""the Era of Great Power""). The beginning of the empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and its end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, the empire was controlled for lengthy periods by part of the high nobility, such as the Oxenstierna family, acting as regents for minor monarchs. The interests of the high nobility contrasted with the uniformity policy (i.e., upholding the traditional equality in status of the Swedish estates favoured by the kings and peasantry). In territories acquired during the periods of de facto noble rule, serfdom was not abolished, and there was also a trend to set up respective estates in Sweden proper. The Great Reduction of 1680 put an end to these efforts of the nobility and required them to return estates once gained from the crown to the king. Serfdom, however, remained in force in the dominions acquired in the Holy Roman Empire and in Swedish Estonia, where a consequent application of the uniformity policy was hindered by the treaties by which they were gained. After its victories in the Thirty Years' War, Sweden reached the height of its power during the Second Northern War, when its primary adversary, Denmark–Norway, was neutralized by the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. However, in the further course of this war, as well as in the subsequent Scanian War, Sweden was able to maintain its empire only with the support of its closest ally, France. Charles XI of Sweden consolidated the empire. But a decline began with his son, Charles XII. After initial Swedish victories, Charles secured the empire for some time in the Peace of Travendal (1700) and the Treaty of Altranstädt (1706), before the disaster that followed the king's war in Russia. The Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava put an end to Sweden's eastbound expansion, and by the time of Charles XII's death in 1718 only a much-weakened and far smaller territory remained. The last traces of occupied continental territory vanished during the Napoleonic Wars, and Finland went to Russia in 1809, with Sweden's role as a great power vanishing as well. Sweden is the only Nordic country to have ever reached the status of a military great power.

[Path 3]
  1. Swedish_Empire → eventStart → Gustavus Adolphus is crowned King of Sweden";"The evidence clearly supports the claim that the Swedish Empire was ruled by Gustavus Adolphus before he died in 1632. 

1. The first snippet confirms that Gustavus Adolphus was King of Sweden from 1611 until his death in 1632, indicating that he ruled during the time the Swedish Empire was rising as a great power in Europe. It also highlights his significant contributions to military and administrative reforms during his reign.

2. The second snippet provides context about the Swedish Empire, stating that its beginning is usually marked by the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, further reinforcing that he was indeed the ruler during the early period of the empire's prominence.

3. The third snippet explicitly states that Gustavus Adolphus was crowned King of Sweden, which aligns with the timeline of his rule.

Overall, the evidence is sufficient as it directly addresses the claim and provides historical context and details about Gustavus Adolphus's reign and its significance to the Swedish Empire.";;

1. **Nature of the Evidence**: The evidence consistently identifies ""Star Trek"" as a 2009 film, specifically the eleventh feature film in the Star Trek franchise, directed by J.J. Abrams. Multiple sources confirm that it is a movie, not a television show. For example, one snippet states, ""Star Trek (Paramount Pictures, 2009) is the eleventh feature film based on the popular science fiction television series, Star Trek: The Original Series.""

2. **Contradictory Statements**: The evidence includes numerous statements that directly contradict the claim. Phrases like ""Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction action film"" and ""Star Trek (2009) introduces a new cast as younger versions of the Original Series characters"" reinforce that the subject in question is a film, not a television series.

3. **Contextual Clarity**: The snippets clarify that while the film is based on the original television series, it is distinctly a cinematic release. The film serves as a reboot of the franchise, which further emphasizes its nature as a film rather than a television show.

3. **Contradictory Claims**: Some snippets explicitly contradict the claim, stating that Jones had her own career and roles, such as ""Jones's first major screen role was in Conan the Destroyer,"" which emphasizes her individual contribution rather than any representation of Schwarzenegger.

Overall, the evidence does not clearly support the claim that Grace Jones acted on behalf of Arnold Schwarzenegger; instead, it suggests that she was an independent actor in her own right, often working alongside him. Therefore, the claim is refuted by the evidence.";;

Specifically, one snippet states that ""Furia is a young adult fiction novel written by Yamile Saied Mendez,"" which indicates that it is an original work rather than an adaptation of Carver's story.

62;Elizabeth I of England had no children and thus was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Elizabeth_I → abstract → Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 – 24 March 1603) was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death in 1603. Elizabeth was the last of the five House of Tudor monarchs and is sometimes referred to as the ""Virgin Queen"". Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, his second wife, who was executed when Elizabeth was two years old. Anne's marriage to Henry was annulled, and Elizabeth was for a time declared illegitimate. Her half-brother Edward VI ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of statute law to the contrary. Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels. Upon her half-sister's death in 1558, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers led by William Cecil, whom she created 1st Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the supreme governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, James VI of Scotland; this laid the foundation for the Kingdom of Great Britain. She had earlier been reluctantly responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. In government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been. One of her mottoes was ""video et taceo"" (""I see and keep silent""). In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service, run by Francis Walsingham. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid war with Spain. As she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her virginity. A cult of personality grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the Elizabethan era. The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, the prowess of English maritime adventurers, such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, and for the defeat of the Spanish Armada. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer (""Gloriana"") and a dogged survivor (""Good Queen Bess"") in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped to forge a sense of national identity.

  1. House_of_Tudor → abstract → The House of Tudor was a royal house of largely Welsh origin that held the English throne from 1485 to 1603. They descended from the Tudors of Penmynydd and Catherine of France. Tudor monarchs ruled the Kingdom of England and its realms, including their ancestral Wales and the Lordship of Ireland (later the Kingdom of Ireland) for 118 years with six monarchs: Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Jane Grey, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The Tudors succeeded the House of Plantagenet as rulers of the Kingdom of England, and were succeeded by the House of Stuart. The first Tudor monarch, Henry VII of England, descended through his mother from a legitimised branch of the English royal House of Lancaster, a cadet house of the Plantagenets. The Tudor family rose to power and started the Tudor period in the wake of the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487), which left the main House of Lancaster (with which the Tudors were aligned) extinct in the male line. Henry VII succeeded in presenting himself as a candidate not only for traditional Lancastrian supporters, but also for discontented supporters of their rival Plantagenet cadet House of York, and he took the throne by right of conquest. Following his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485), he reinforced his position in 1486 by fulfilling his 1483 vow to marry Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, thus symbolically uniting the former warring factions of Lancaster and York under the new dynasty. The Tudors extended their power beyond modern England, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 (Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542), and successfully asserting English authority over the Kingdom of Ireland (proclaimed by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542). They also maintained the nominal English claim to the Kingdom of France; although none of them made substance of it, Henry VIII fought wars with France trying to reclaim that title. After him, his daughter Mary I lost control of all territory in France permanently with the fall of Calais in 1558. In total, the Tudor monarchs ruled their domains for just over a century. Henry VIII (r. 1509–1547) was the only son of Henry VII to live to the age of maturity. Issues around royal succession (including marriage and the succession rights of women) became major political themes during the Tudor era, as did the English Reformation in religion, impacting the future of the Crown. When Elizabeth I died childless, the Scottish House of Stuart succeeded as England's royal family through the Union of the Crowns of 24 March 1603. The first Stuart to become King of England (r. 1603–1625), James VI and I, descended from Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor, who in 1503 had married King James IV of Scotland in accordance with the 1502 Treaty of Perpetual Peace.

2. **Last Tudor Monarch**: The evidence confirms that Elizabeth I was the last of the five House of Tudor monarchs and that upon her death, the crown passed to James VI of Scotland, marking the end of the Tudor dynasty. 

3. **Historical Context**: The snippets provide a historical context that reinforces the claim, detailing the succession of monarchs in the Tudor line and the transition to the House of Stuart after Elizabeth's death.

  1. Brian_Eno → abstract → Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno RDI (/ˈiːnoʊ/; born Brian Peter George Eno, 15 May 1948) is a British musician, composer, record producer and visual artist best known for his contributions to ambient music and work in rock, pop and electronica. A self-described ""non-musician"", Eno has helped introduce unconventional concepts and approaches to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as its synthesiser player in 1971, recording two albums with the group before departing in 1973. Eno then released a number of solo pop albums beginning with Here Come the Warm Jets (1974) and, also in the mid-1970s, began exploring a minimalist direction on influential recordings such as Discreet Music (1975) and Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978), coining the term ""ambient music"" with the latter. Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp, Harmonia, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, David Byrne and Judy Nylon. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, alongside work with artists such as Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn. Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation. In 2019, Eno was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.

At age 16, she signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records. Her debut studio album, Let Go (2002), is the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. It yielded the singles ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi"", which emphasized a skate punk persona and earned her the title ""Pop Punk Queen"" from music publications. She is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music, since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s. Her second studio album, Under My Skin (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide. Lavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007), reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single ""Girlfriend"", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her next two studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories. After releasing her sixth studio album, Head Above Water (2019), she returned to her punk roots with her seventh studio album, Love Sux (2022). Alongside her music career, Lavigne voiced an animated character in the film Over the Hedge (2006), and made her screen acting debut in Fast Food Nation (2006). Her accolades include eight Grammy Awards nominations.

... (88 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence clearly supports the claim that ""How I Met Your Mother"" is a long-running show. 

1. **Duration and Episodes**: Multiple pieces of evidence confirm that the show aired for nine seasons and a total of 208 episodes from 2005 to 2014. For example, one snippet states, ""HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, a groundbreaking sitcom that ran for 208 episodes on CBS from 2005-2014,"" which directly supports the claim of it being long-running.

2. **General Consensus**: The term ""long-running"" is often associated with shows that have a significant number of episodes and seasons, and the evidence consistently highlights the show's extensive run, with phrases like ""the long-running CBS hit"" and ""for 9 years, the romantic comedy 'How I Met Your Mother' delighted fans.""

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The context provided in the snippets indicates that the show was not only long-running but also popular and influential during its airing, further solidifying its status as a long-running series.

The club competes in the Premier League, the highest level of England's football league system, and plays its home matches at King Power Stadium. The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C, playing on a field near Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football League in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002, which was renamed King Power Stadium in 2011. Leicester won the 2015–16 Premier League, becoming one of seven clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception in 1992. Their previous highest ever league finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928–29, then known as the First Division. Leicester have seven second-tier titles to their name, a joint record at this level of English football. The club have competed in the FA Cup final five times, winning their first title in 2021. The club have also won the League Cup three times in 1964, 1997 and 2000.

Additionally, several snippets contradict the claim, indicating that the name ""Whiskers"" is associated with other contexts or individuals, rather than Wynonna Judd's cat.

73;KFC transferred to Sears.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Sears → abstract → Sears, Roebuck and Co. (/sɪərz/ SEERZ), commonly known as Sears, is an American chain of department stores founded in 1892 by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck and reincorporated in 1906 by Richard Sears and Julius Rosenwald, with what began as a mail ordering catalog company migrating to opening retail locations in 1925, the first in Chicago. In 2005, the company was bought by the management of the American big box discount chain Kmart, which upon completion of the merger, formed Sears Holdings. Through the 1980s, Sears was the largest retailer in the United States. In 2018, it was the 31st-largest. After several years of declining sales, Sears's parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 15, 2018. It announced on January 16, 2019, that it had won its bankruptcy auction, and that a reduced number of 425 stores would remain open, including 223 Sears stores. Sears was based in the Sears Tower in Chicago from 1973 until 1995, and is currently headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Sears announced in 2021 that it would be selling its Hoffman Estates headquarters complex.

  1. KFC → abstract → KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, that specializes in fried chicken. It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019. The chain is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains. KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders (1890–1980), an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" franchise opened in Utah in 1952. KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger. By branding himself as ""Colonel Sanders"", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964. KFC was one of the first American fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R. J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987 it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China. It has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market. PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands. KFC's original product is pressure-fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' signature recipe of ""11 herbs and spices"". The constituents of the recipe are a trade secret. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard ""bucket"", which has become a feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957. Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet sandwiches and wraps, as well as salads and side dishes such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts and soft drinks; the latter often supplied by PepsiCo. KFC is known for its slogans ""It's Finger Lickin' Good!"", ""Nobody does chicken like KFC"" and ""So good"".";"The evidence provided does not support the claim that KFC transferred to Sears. 

1. **Nature of the Claim**: The claim suggests a transfer of ownership or a merger between KFC and Sears, which would imply that KFC is now part of Sears or that the two companies have combined in some significant way.

2. **Evidence Analysis**: 
   - The first snippet discusses Sears, its history, and its financial struggles, but it does not mention any connection to KFC or any transfer of ownership.
   - The second snippet provides information about KFC, including its status as a subsidiary of Yum! Brands and its history, but again, there is no mention of any relationship with Sears or a transfer of ownership.

3. **Conclusion**: The evidence is insufficient to support the claim because it does not provide any information indicating that KFC has been transferred to Sears. Instead, both companies are described independently without any connection. Therefore, the claim is not substantiated by the evidence provided.";;

Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Several sources indicate that the population of San Jose in 2017 was higher than the claimed figure. For instance, one source states the population was 1,037,082, while another mentions a peak population of 1,032,000. These figures contradict the claim.

2. **Neutral Evidence**: There are also sources that provide varying estimates, such as 1,029,000 and 1,030,119, which are still above the claimed figure but do not definitively confirm it.

3. **Insufficient Consensus**: The evidence does not converge on a single figure that supports the claim. Instead, it presents a range of estimates, with some being higher than the claim and others being neutral or vague.

In conclusion, the evidence is insufficient because it does not provide a clear consensus on the population figure for San Jose in 2017, with multiple sources contradicting the claim and others providing estimates that do not support it.";;

Born in Guildford, Surrey and raised in Los Angeles, Collins began performing on screen at the age of two in the BBC sitcom Growing Pains. In the late 2000s, Collins began acting and modelling more regularly, and she had a career breakthrough with her performance in the sports-drama film The Blind Side, which was the third highest-grossing film of 2009. She went on to appear in leading roles across feature films such as the sci-fi action-horror Priest (2011), the psychological action-thriller Abduction (2011), the fantasy Mirror Mirror (2012), the urban fantasy The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones (2013), and the independent romantic comedies Stuck in Love (2012), The English Teacher (2013), and Love, Rosie (2014). Collins was critically acclaimed for her roles as Marla Mabrey in the comedy Rules Don't Apply (2016), which earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and for her portrayal of a young adult with anorexia in the controversial Netflix drama To the Bone (2017). She has also achieved recognition for her work in biographical films: she starred as Liz Kendall in the Netflix drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019), as J.R.R. Tolkien's wife Edith in Tolkien (2019), and as Rita Alexander in Mank (2020), the latter of which was a critical success, earning 10 Academy Award nominations. Collins played Fantine in the BBC miniseries adaptation of Les Misérables (2018–2019), and, since 2020, she has portrayed Emily Cooper in the Netflix series Emily in Paris. For the latter, she received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. She made her writing debut with Unfiltered: No Shame, No Regrets, Just Me (2017) in which she discussed her struggles with mental health, including an eating disorder she suffered as a teenager.

  1. Seawater → abstract → Seawater, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions). The average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/L. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/L at 4 °C (39 °F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about −2 °C (28 °F). The coldest seawater still in the liquid state ever recorded was found in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier: the measured temperature was −2.6 °C (27.3 °F). Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4. However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.

Liquid water, which is necessary for life as we know it, continues to exist on the surface of Earth because the planet is at a distance, known as the habitable zone, far enough from the Sun that it does not lose its water, but not so far that low temperatures cause all water on the planet to freeze. It was long thought that Earth’s water did not originate from the planet’s region of the protoplanetary disk. Instead, it was hypothesized water and other volatiles must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. Recent research, however, indicates that hydrogen inside the Earth played a role in the formation of the ocean. The two ideas are not mutually exclusive, as there is also evidence that water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals similar in composition to asteroids in the outer edges of the asteroid belt.

  1. Katsuko_Saruhashi → knownFor → Seawater";"The claim that ""Water on Earth is 96.5% salt water"" is not supported by the evidence provided. 

The evidence indicates that seawater, which is the primary source of salt water on Earth, has an average salinity of about 3.5%. This means that only 3.5% of seawater is composed of dissolved salts, not 96.5%. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as it misrepresents the proportion of salt water in relation to the total water on Earth.

In summary, the evidence clearly refutes the claim because it provides specific information about the salinity of seawater, which is significantly lower than the percentage stated in the claim.";;

  1. Laurence_Olivier → abstract → Laurence Kerr Olivier, Baron Olivier, OM (/ˈlɒrəns ˈkɜːr əˈlɪvieɪ/; 22 May 1907 – 11 July 1989) was an English actor and director who, along with his contemporaries Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, was one of a trio of male actors who dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. Late in his career, he had considerable success in television roles. His family had no theatrical connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided that his son should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant-garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1965) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970). Among Olivier's films are Wuthering Heights (1939), Rebecca (1940), and a trilogy of Shakespeare films as actor/director: Henry V (1944), Hamlet (1948), and Richard III (1955). His later films included Spartacus (1960), The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968), Sleuth (1972), Marathon Man (1976), and The Boys from Brazil (1978). His television appearances included an adaptation of The Moon and Sixpence (1960), Long Day's Journey into Night (1973), Love Among the Ruins (1975), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1976), Brideshead Revisited (1981) and King Lear (1983). Olivier's honours included a knighthood (1947), a life peerage (1970) and the Order of Merit (1981). For his on-screen work he received four Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, five Emmy Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards. The National Theatre's largest auditorium is named in his honour, and he is commemorated in the Laurence Olivier Awards, given annually by the Society of London Theatre. He was married three times, to the actresses Jill Esmond from 1930 to 1940, Vivien Leigh from 1940 to 1960, and Joan Plowright from 1961 until his death.

  1. Hawaii_Five-0_(2010_TV_series) → abstract → Hawaii Five-0 is an American action police procedural television series that centers around a special police major crimes task force operating at the behest of the governor of Hawaii. It is a reboot of the 1968–1980 series Hawaii Five-O (the original series had the letter ""O"" instead of the number ""0"" in its title), which also aired on CBS. The series was produced by K/O Paper Products and 101st Street Entertainment, initially in association with CBS Productions, then CBS Television Studios starting in season three. The show received praise for its modern take on the original series. The series premiered on September 20, 2010, on CBS and aired on Mondays for its first three seasons. Beginning with season four, the program was moved to Fridays. Hawaii Five-0 ran for seven additional seasons and concluded with its 240th and final episode on April 3, 2020. Peter M. Lenkov, one of the show's developers, created two additional police shows that were reboots of previous TV series: MacGyver and Magnum P.I. All three take place in the same fictional universe, and Hawaii Five-0 had crossover episodes with both of the others. The three shows have been collectively referred to as the ""Lenkov-verse"". The series also exists in the same fictional universe as the NCIS franchise by way of a crossover event with NCIS: Los Angeles.

The evidence states that the 2010 series is a modern take on the original, indicating that it is not a direct sequel but rather a reimagining of the original concept. 

The key points from the evidence are:
1. The 2010 series is described as a reboot of the original series, which implies it is based on the same premise but updated for a contemporary audience.
2. The original series had a different title (""Hawaii Five-O"" with an ""O"" instead of a ""0""), which further emphasizes the connection between the two shows.
3. The reboot has been praised for its modern interpretation, suggesting it retains the essence of the original while presenting it in a new format.

Therefore, while the term ""sequel"" might imply a continuation of the story from the original series, the evidence indicates that ""Hawaii Five-0"" is more accurately classified as a reboot rather than a direct sequel. Thus, the claim is somewhat misleading, as it does not fully capture the nature of the relationship between the two series.";;
79;Game of Thrones has five movies.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Game_of_Thrones → abstract → Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons. Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border. Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base. Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been subject to criticism. The final season received significant critical backlash for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama. A prequel series, House of the Dragon, premiered on HBO in 2022.

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that Mike Love was inducted into the National Honor Society is insufficient. 

While there are several snippets that mention ""induction"" and ""National Honor Society,"" they do not specifically confirm that Mike Love himself was inducted into this organization. The snippets include references to other individuals and events related to the National Honor Society, but they do not provide direct evidence of Mike Love's induction. 

Additionally, there are multiple contradictions in the evidence, particularly regarding Mike Love's involvement in other honor societies, such as the Songwriters Hall of Fame, which further complicates the claim. The presence of contradictory evidence suggests that the claim may not be accurate, but without definitive evidence confirming or refuting Mike Love's induction into the National Honor Society, the overall conclusion remains insufficient.

Diego_Costa → abstract → Diego da Silva Costa (Spanish: [ˈdjeɣo ða ˈsilβa ˈkosta], Portuguese: [ˈdʒjeɡu dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈkɔstɐ]; born 7 October 1988), commonly known as Diego Costa, is a professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Spain national team. Costa began his football career in his native Brazil before joining Braga in Portugal in 2006, aged 17. He never played for the club but spent time on loan at Penafiel, and signed with Atlético Madrid the following year. Over the next two seasons he had loan periods with Braga, Celta Vigo and Albacete. His form earned him a move to fellow La Liga club Real Valladolid in 2009, where he spent one season, finishing as their top goalscorer, before returning to Atlético Madrid. Costa struggled to maintain a regular starting role with Atlético, and spent more time on loan, this time at Rayo Vallecano, where he finished as the club's highest scorer that season. In 2011 Costa returned to Atlético with a greater role. He blossomed as a goalscorer, and helped the team win a La Liga title, a Copa del Rey title, and a UEFA Super Cup. His performances attracted the attention of several big clubs, and in 2014 Costa was transferred to Premier League club Chelsea in a deal worth €35 million (£32 million). In London, Costa won three trophies, including two Premier League titles, and a League Cup. In 2018, following a rift with head coach Antonio Conte, Costa returned to Atlético Madrid in a club record transfer worth an initial €56 million, where he won a UEFA Europa League title and another UEFA Super Cup. Costa is a dual citizen of Brazil and Spain. He played twice for Brazil in 2013, before declaring his desire to represent Spain, having been granted Spanish citizenship in September that year. He made his debut for Spain in March 2014, and has since won 24 caps and scored 10 goals, and has represented them at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups. Known for his fiery temperament, Costa has been criticised and punished for several confrontations with opponents.

It also mentions that he made his debut for Spain in March 2014 and has represented the team in major tournaments, including the FIFA World Cups in 2014 and 2018. This directly confirms the first part of the claim.

2. **Having a Fan Base**: While the evidence does not explicitly mention the size or nature of Diego Costa's fan base, it can be inferred from his career achievements, including playing for prominent clubs and winning multiple titles, that he has garnered a following. Players of his caliber typically have fan bases due to their performances and public presence.

Overall, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim regarding Diego Costa's involvement with the Spain national team, and while it does not explicitly state the existence of a fan base, it strongly implies it based on his professional stature.";;

However, the claim that ""Black Panther is a communist"" is somewhat ambiguous. If ""Black Panther"" refers to the Black Panther Party, then the evidence does support the claim, as it shows that certain factions of the party have been associated with communist ideology. 

On the other hand, if ""Black Panther"" refers to the Marvel character or the film, the evidence does not support the claim at all, as the character and the film do not espouse communist ideology.

In summary, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim if it pertains to the Black Panther Party as a political organization.

The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon, Sunny, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Yuri, Sooyoung, Yoona, and Seohyun. Originally a nine-piece ensemble, Jessica departed from the group in September 2014. Among the prominent South Korean figures and most popular K-pop groups worldwide, Girls' Generation has earned numerous accolades and the honorific nickname ""The Nation's Girl Group"" in their home country. Girls' Generation debuted on August 5, 2007, with the single ""Into the New World"" from their eponymous Korean album. The group rose to fame in 2009 with the single ""Gee"", which claimed the top spot on KBS's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was Melon's most popular song of the 2000s decade. The group cemented their popularity in Asia with follow-up singles ""Genie"", ""Oh!"", and ""Run Devil Run"", which were released between mid-2009 and early 2010. Their second Korean studio album, Oh! (2010), won the Golden Disc award for Album of the Year (Disk Daesang), making the group the first and only female act to win the Album Daesang. Girls' Generation ventured into the Japanese music scene in 2011 with their eponymous Japanese album, which became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified million by the RIAJ. The group's third Korean studio album, The Boys, was the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea. An English version of the single ""The Boys"" was released in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's fourth Korean studio album, I Got a Boy (2013), was supported by the title track, which won Video of the Year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards. Girls' Generation continued to build upon their popularity with their fifth and sixth Korean studio albums, Lion Heart (2015) and Holiday Night (2017). Following a five-year hiatus to focus on their individual careers, they returned with their seventh Korean studio album Forever 1 (2022). The group's signature musical styles are characterized as electropop and bubblegum pop, though their sound has varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip hop, R&B, and EDM. In 2017, Billboard honoured Girls' Generation as the ""Top K-pop Girl Group of the Past Decade"". They are the first Asian girl group to achieve five music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube with ""Gee"", ""I Got a Boy"", ""The Boys"", ""Mr. Taxi"", and ""Oh!"". In Japan, they became the first non-Japanese girl group to have three number-one albums on the Oricon Albums Chart, and their three Japanese concert tours attracted a record-breaking 550,000 spectators.

In summary, the evidence is sufficient to refute the claim because it clearly outlines the group's musical characteristics and styles, which do not align with the definition of an a capella group.

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that ""Keith Urban presented a Grammy"" is mixed, with several pieces of evidence supporting the claim and others contradicting it.

1. **Supporting Evidence**:
   - There are multiple instances where it is explicitly stated that Keith Urban presented at the Grammy Awards. For example, one snippet mentions, ""Keith Urban presented a Grammy tonight,"" which directly supports the claim (confidence: 0.993).
   - Another snippet states, ""Keith Urban's presentation at the Grammy's 2017,"" indicating that he was involved in presenting at that event (confidence: 0.983).
   - Additionally, there is evidence that he was a presenter at the 2020 Grammy Awards, further supporting the claim (confidence: 0.983).

2. **Contradicting Evidence**:
   - Some snippets indicate that he was recognized or awarded at various Grammy events rather than presenting awards. For instance, one snippet mentions that he was awarded the Recording Artists' Coalition Award at the 2017 Grammys on the Hill Awards, which does not support the claim of him presenting a Grammy (confidence: 0.614).
   - Other snippets discuss his performances or interviews at the Grammys without mentioning any presentation role, which could imply that he was not presenting at those specific events.

3. **Neutral Evidence**:
   - There are also several neutral snippets that do not provide clear support or contradiction to the claim, such as mentions of his attendance or performances at the Grammy Awards.

**Conclusion**: The evidence is sufficient to support the claim that Keith Urban presented a Grammy, particularly with the strong snippets indicating his role as a presenter at specific Grammy events. However, there are also contradictions that suggest he has been recognized in other capacities, which could lead to some confusion. Overall, the claim is supported by credible evidence.";;

89;Gregory Peck appeared in a film directed and produced by William Wyler.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. William_Wyler → abstract → William Wyler (/ˈwaɪlər/; born Willi Wyler (German: [ˈvɪli ˈvi:lɐ]); July 1, 1902 – July 27, 1981) was a Swiss-German-American film director and producer who won the Academy Award for Best Director three times, those being for Mrs. Miniver (1942), The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), and Ben-Hur (1959), all of which also won for Best Picture. In total, he holds a record twelve nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director. Born in Alsace, then in Germany, but later part of France, Wyler was a troublemaker in the schools of his youth. He immigrated to United States in 1921, working first for Universal Studios in New York before moving to Los Angeles. By 1925, he was the youngest director at Universal, and in 1929 he directed Hell's Heroes, Universal's first sound production filmed entirely on location. In 1936, he earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for Dodsworth, starring Walter Huston, Ruth Chatterton and Mary Astor, ""sparking a 20-year run of almost unbroken greatness."" He helped propel a number of actors to stardom, including finding and directing Audrey Hepburn in her debut starring role, Roman Holiday (1953), and directing Barbra Streisand in her debut film, Funny Girl (1968), both winning Academy Awards. Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis both won their second Oscar in Wyler films, de Havilland for The Heiress (1949) and Davis for Jezebel (1938). Davis said Wyler made her a ""far, far better actress"" than she had ever been, while Laurence Olivier, who received his first Oscar nomination for Wyler's Wuthering Heights (1939), credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen. Wyler's three Best Picture-winning films each featured a Best Actress or Actor Oscar winner - Greer Garson in Mrs Miniver, Frederic March in The Best Years of Our Lives, and Charlton Heston in Ben-Hur. Other popular Wyler films include: The Westerner (1940) with Gary Cooper, The Letter (1940) again with Davis, Detective Story (1951) with Kirk Douglas, Friendly Persuasion (1956) with Cooper, The Big Country (1958) with Gregory Peck and Heston, The Children's Hour (1961) with Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine and James Garner, and How to Steal a Million (1966) with Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. Film historian Ian Freer calls Wyler a ""bona fide perfectionist"", whose penchant for retakes and an attempt to hone every last nuance, ""became the stuff of legend."" His ability to direct a string of classic literary adaptations into huge box-office and critical successes made him one of ""Hollywood's most bankable moviemakers"" from the 1930s to 1960s. Through his talent for staging, editing, and camera movement, he turned dynamic theatrical spaces into cinematic ones. For his work Wyler was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for career achievement, the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award, and the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award.

  1. Gregory_Peck → abstract → Eldred Gregory Peck (April 5, 1916 – June 12, 2003) was an American actor and one of the most popular film stars from the 1940s to the 1970s. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Peck the 12th-greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema. After studying at the Neighborhood Playhouse with Sanford Meisner, Peck began appearing in stage productions, acting in over 50 plays and three Broadway productions. He first gained critical success in The Keys of the Kingdom (1944), a John M. Stahl–directed drama which earned him his first Academy Award nomination. He starred in a series of successful films, including romantic-drama The Valley of Decision (1944), Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), and family film The Yearling (1946). He encountered lukewarm commercial reviews at the end of the 1940s, his performances including The Paradine Case (1947) and The Great Sinner (1948). Peck reached global recognition in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing back-to-back in the book-to-film adaptation of Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951) and biblical drama David and Bathsheba (1951). He starred alongside Ava Gardner in The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952) and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday (1953), which earned Peck a Golden Globe award. Other notable films in which he appeared include Moby Dick (1956, and its 1998 mini-series), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Cape Fear (1962, and its 1991 remake), The Omen (1976), and The Boys from Brazil (1978). Throughout his career, he often portrayed protagonists with ""fiber"" within a moral setting. Gentleman's Agreement (1947) centered on topics of antisemitism, while Peck's character in Twelve O'Clock High (1949) dealt with post-traumatic stress disorder during World War II. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), an adaptation of the modern classic of the same name which revolved around racial inequality, for which he received universal acclaim. In 1983, he starred opposite Christopher Plummer in The Scarlet and The Black as Hugh O'Flaherty, a Catholic priest who saved thousands of escaped Allied POWs and Jewish people in Rome during the Second World War. Peck was also active in politics, challenging the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 and was regarded as a political opponent by President Richard Nixon. President Lyndon B. Johnson honored Peck with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 for his lifetime humanitarian efforts. Peck died in his sleep from bronchopneumonia at the age of 87.

This directly confirms the claim that Peck was involved in a film under Wyler's direction. Additionally, the snippets provide background information on both Gregory Peck and William Wyler, establishing their prominence in the film industry and further supporting the connection between the two.

It also notes that he can be referred to by the patronymic ""Loki Fárbautason,"" which means ""son of Fárbauti,"" confirming that Farbauti is his father.

2. The second snippet explicitly states that Loki is the son of the giant Farbauti and that Laufey (also referred to as Nal) is his mother. This directly supports the claim.

3. The third snippet reiterates that Loki can be referred to as the son of both Farbauti and Laufey, further solidifying the relationship.

Dharanikota, the ancient city site nearby, was founded more than 2,200 years ago, serving as an ancient capital. The Amaravati Stupa was an important Buddhist site of pilgrimage and holy learning. Under the British Raj, many ancient Buddhist sculptures were taken to other museums in India and Britain. The office of the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh has operated from Velagapudi since April 2016.

Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008. This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble. This was followed by two consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21 and 2021–22, the third and fourth in the Guardiola era, as well as the club's first-ever Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. Although Manchester City have yet to win a UEFA Champions League title, by the 2022–23 season they had qualified to play in the competition for twelve consecutive seasons and reached the knockout stages for ten consecutive seasons. Furthermore, the club was ranked third in the UEFA coefficient standings at the end of the 2021–22 campaign, reaching its highest ever position. Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2020–21 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €644.9 million. In 2021, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth most valuable in the world, worth $4 billion. Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a British-based holding company valued at £3.73 (US$4.8) billion in November 2019.

95;H. H. Holmes was known under the stage name Dr. Henry Howard Holmes.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. H._H._Holmes → abstract → Herman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 – May 7, 1896), better known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes, was an American con artist and serial killer, the subject of more than 50 lawsuits in Chicago alone. Until his execution in 1896, he chose a career of crime including insurance fraud, swindling, check forging, three to four bigamous illegal marriages, horse theft and murder. Despite his confession of 27 murders (including some people who were verifiably still alive) while awaiting execution, Holmes was convicted and sentenced to death for only one murder, that of accomplice and business partner Benjamin Pitezel. It is believed he killed three of the Pitezel children, as well as three mistresses, the child of one of the said mistresses and the sister of another. Holmes was executed on May 7, 1896, nine days before his 35th birthday. Much of the lore surrounding the ""Murder Castle"" along with many of his alleged crimes are considered likely exaggerated or fabricated for sensationalistic tabloid pieces. Many of these factual inaccuracies have persisted due to the combination of ineffective police investigation and hyperbolic tabloid journalism, which are often cited as historical record. Holmes gave various contradictory accounts of his life, initially claiming innocence and later that he was possessed by Satan. His propensity for lying has made it difficult for researchers to ascertain the truth on the basis of his statements. Since the 1990s, Holmes has often been described as a serial killer, however, Adam Selzer points out in his book on Holmes, ""Just killing several people isn't necessarily enough for most definitions [of a serial killer]. More often, it has to be a series of similar crimes, committed over a period of time, usually more to satisfy a psychological urge on the killer's part than any more practical motive."" and ""The murders we can connect him [Holmes] to generally had a clear motive: someone knew too much, or was getting in his way, and couldn't be trusted. The murders weren't simply for love of bloodshed but a necessary part of furthering his swindling operations and protecting his lifestyle.""

96;Matt Damon's character in The Martian is mistakenly presumed dead and left behind on Venus.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. The_Martian_(film) → abstract → The Martian is a 2015 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon. Drew Goddard adapted the screenplay from the 2011 novel The Martian by Andy Weir. The film depicts an astronaut's lone struggle to survive on Mars after being left behind and the efforts of NASA to rescue him and bring him home to Earth. It also stars Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Mackenzie Davis, Donald Glover, and Benedict Wong. Produced through 20th Century Fox, the film is a coproduction of the United Kingdom and the United States. Producer Simon Kinberg began developing the film after Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard as director, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on one of the largest sound stages in the world in Budapest, Hungary. Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used for exterior filming. The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2015, while the London premiere was held on September 24, 2015. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2015, and in the United States on October 2, 2015, in 2D, 3D, IMAX 3D and 4DX. It received positive reviews and grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date, as well as the 10th-highest-grossing film of 2015. The Martian received praise for its direction, visual effects, musical score, screenplay, scientific accuracy, and likability, largely due to Damon's performance. It received several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, seven nominations at the 88th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Goddard, and the 2016 long form Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Damon won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor.

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence provided is largely supportive of the claim that a reflex occurs in response to an illness. Here are the key points:

1. **Entailment Evidence**: Several pieces of evidence explicitly support the claim. For instance, one snippet states, ""A reflex arc is a part of the nervous system involved in making a reflex response... illnesses such as pneumonia, infections, blood clots, and wounds..."" This directly connects reflex responses to various illnesses, indicating that reflexes can indeed occur in response to illness.

2. **General Understanding of Reflexes**: Other snippets describe reflexes as automatic responses to stimuli, which can include various health conditions. For example, ""A reflex is a muscle reaction that happens automatically in response to stimulation,"" and ""Reflex responses are rapid, stereotyped involuntary movements elicited by a stimulus."" This suggests that reflexes are not only a response to physical stimuli but can also be influenced by health conditions.

3. **Specific Illness-Related Reflexes**: Some evidence mentions specific reflexes related to illnesses, such as the cough reflex being triggered by irritants in the throat, which can be associated with respiratory illnesses.

4. **Neurological Conditions**: There are references to how certain illnesses can affect reflexes, such as ""Some viral or bacterial infections can result in neuropathy that affects reflexes,"" indicating that illness can alter reflex responses.

5. **Contradictory Evidence**: While there are some snippets that could be seen as contradictory or neutral, they do not significantly undermine the overall support for the claim. For example, some snippets discuss reflexes in general terms without directly linking them to illness, but they do not refute the idea that reflexes can be a response to illness.

In conclusion, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim that a reflex occurs in response to an illness, as multiple sources directly link reflex actions to various health conditions and describe the mechanisms involved.";;

... (64 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence found is sufficient to refute the claim that Dwyane Wade is a Protestant. Multiple sources indicate that while Wade identifies as a devout Christian, he has participated in activities associated with the Latter-day Saints (Mormon) faith, such as giving a closing prayer at a Latter-day Saint baptism. This suggests that his religious affiliation may not align with Protestantism, which is distinct from the beliefs and practices of the Latter-day Saints.

Key points from the evidence include:

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Several snippets explicitly state that Wade is a Christian but also mention his involvement with the Latter-day Saints, which contradicts the claim of him being a Protestant. For example, one source states, ""Dwyane Wade attended a Latter-day Saint baptism and gave the closing prayer at said baptism.""

2. **Conflicting Denominations**: The evidence indicates that Wade's faith may encompass elements outside of traditional Protestantism, as he is described as having a relationship with the Latter-day Saints, which is a separate denomination.

3. **General Christian Identity**: While Wade identifies as a Christian and expresses his faith, the specific claim of him being a Protestant is not supported by the evidence, as it highlights his connections to other Christian denominations.

In conclusion, the evidence clearly refutes the claim that Dwyane Wade is a Protestant, as it points to his involvement with the Latter-day Saints and indicates a broader Christian identity that does not fit neatly into the Protestant category.";;

Joffrey is officially the eldest son and heir of king Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister, but in actuality is the eldest child of Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister. Joffrey inherits the throne after Robert's death, which, along with his execution of Lord Ned Stark of Winterfell, triggers a power struggle in Westeros known as the War of Five Kings. He is characterized as a spoiled, sadistic bully and frequently torments his family as well as Sansa Stark, to whom he is betrothed in the first novel. He later marries Margaery Tyrell, but is killed by poison during his wedding reception. Joffrey's demise is referred to as The Purple Wedding.

Craven filmed A Nightmare on Elm Street on an estimated budget of $1.1 million. The film was released on November 9, 1984, and grossed $57 million worldwide. A Nightmare on Elm Street was met with rave critical reviews and is considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, spawning a franchise consisting of six sequels, a television series, a crossover with Friday the 13th, various other merchandise, and a remake of the same name. Aside from Stunts, Polyester, and Alone in the Dark, it was one of the first films produced by New Line Cinema, who by that point mostly distributed films, leading the company to become a successful mini-major film studio and was even nicknamed ""The House that Freddy Built"". The film is credited with using many of the tropes found in the low-budget horror films of the 1970s and 1980s that originated with John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). The film includes a morality play where sexually promiscuous teenagers are killed. Critics and film historians state that the film's premise is the struggle to define the distinction between dreams and reality, manifested by the lives and dreams of the teens in the film. Later critics praise the film's ability to transgress ""the boundaries between the imaginary and real"", toying with audience perceptions. The film was followed by A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

1. **Context of A Nightmare on Elm Street**: The evidence describes ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" as a 1984 horror film created by Wes Craven, detailing its plot, production, and cultural significance. It emphasizes that the film is part of a franchise and has no mention of any connection to ""The Vampire Diaries.""

2. **Lack of Connection**: The evidence does not provide any information that links ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" to ""The Vampire Diaries,"" which is a supernatural drama series that premiered in 2009. There is no indication that one was intended as a reboot of the other.

3. **Temporal Discrepancy**: The two works were created in different decades, with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" being released in 1984 and ""The Vampire Diaries"" starting in 2009. This temporal gap further supports the idea that they are unrelated.

In conclusion, the evidence is insufficient to support the claim, as it does not establish any connection between the two works, nor does it suggest that one was intended as a reboot of the other.";;

  1. Hubert_Humphrey → abstract → Hubert Horatio Humphrey Jr. (May 27, 1911 – January 13, 1978) was an American pharmacist and politician who served as the 38th vice president of the United States from 1965 to 1969. He twice served in the United States Senate, representing Minnesota from 1949 to 1964 and 1971 to 1978. As a senator he was a major leader of modern liberalism in the United States. As President Lyndon B. Johnson's vice president, he supported the controversial Vietnam War. An intensely divided Democratic Party nominated him in the 1968 presidential election, which he lost to Republican nominee Richard Nixon. Born in Wallace, South Dakota, Humphrey attended the University of Minnesota. In 1943, he became a professor of political science at Macalester College and ran a failed campaign for mayor of Minneapolis. He helped found the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) in 1944; the next year he was elected mayor of Minneapolis, serving until 1948 and co-founding the liberal anti-communist group Americans for Democratic Action in 1947. In 1948, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and successfully advocated for the inclusion of a proposal to end racial segregation in the 1948 Democratic National Convention's party platform. Humphrey served three terms in the Senate from 1949 to 1964, and was the Senate Majority Whip for the last four years of his tenure. During this time, he was the lead author of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, introduced the first initiative to create the Peace Corps, and chaired the Select Committee on Disarmament. He unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 1952 and 1960. After Lyndon B. Johnson acceded to the presidency, he chose Humphrey as his running mate, and the Democratic ticket won a landslide victory in the 1964 election. In March 1968, Johnson made his surprise announcement that he would not seek reelection, and Humphrey launched his campaign for the presidency. Loyal to the Johnson administration's policies on the Vietnam War, he received opposition from many within his own party and avoided the primaries to focus on winning the delegates of non-primary states at the Democratic National Convention. His delegate strategy succeeded in clinching the nomination, and he chose Senator Edmund Muskie as his running mate. In the general election, he nearly matched Nixon's tally in the popular vote but lost the electoral vote by a wide margin. After the defeat, he returned to the Senate and served from 1971 until his death in 1978. He ran again in the primaries but lost to George McGovern and declined to be McGovern's running mate. From 1977 to 1978, he served as Deputy President pro tempore of the United States Senate.

The key points from the evidence include:

1. **Tenure as Senate Majority Whip**: The evidence states that Humphrey served as the Senate Majority Whip for the last four years of his tenure in the Senate, which aligns with the claim that he held this position during the years 1961 to 1964.

2. **Senate Service**: It is confirmed that Humphrey served in the U.S. Senate from 1949 to 1964, which includes the specified years of the claim.

3. **Role and Contributions**: The evidence highlights his significant role in the Senate, including being a major leader of modern liberalism and authoring key legislation, which further supports his leadership position as Majority Whip during that time.

  1. Carrie_Fisher → abstract → Carrie Frances Fisher (October 21, 1956 – December 27, 2016) was an American actress and writer. She played Princess Leia in the Star Wars films (1977–1983). She reprised the role in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017)—a posthumous release that was dedicated to her—and appeared in The Rise of Skywalker (2019), through the use of unreleased footage from The Force Awakens. Fisher's other film credits include Shampoo (1975), The Blues Brothers (1980), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), The 'Burbs (1989), When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Soapdish (1991), and The Women (2008). She was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performances in the NBC sitcom 30 Rock (2007) and the Channel 4 series Catastrophe (2017). Fisher wrote several semi-autobiographical novels, including Postcards from the Edge and an autobiographical one-woman play, and its non-fiction book, Wishful Drinking, based on the play. She wrote the screenplay for the film version of Postcards from the Edge which garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and her one-woman stage show of Wishful Drinking received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special. Fisher worked on other writers' screenplays as a script doctor, including tightening the scripts for Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), and many of the films from the Star Wars franchise, among others. Fisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. She and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. She earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction. Fisher died of a sudden cardiac arrest on December 27, 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. She was posthumously made a Disney Legend in 2017, and in 2018 she was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

The evidence states that Carrie Fisher was born on October 21, 1956, which indicates her birth date. However, the claim about her conception date is not directly supported by the evidence, as conception typically occurs approximately nine months prior to birth. 

To determine the conception date, one would generally calculate back from the birth date. If we assume a typical gestation period of about nine months, Carrie Fisher would have been conceived around January 21, 1956. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to support the claim that she was conceived on October 21, 1956, as it contradicts the typical biological timeline. 

In summary, the evidence is sufficient to confirm her birth date but insufficient to support the claim regarding her conception date.";;

[Path 3]
  1. Daddy_Yankee → abstract → Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez (born February 3, 1976), known professionally as Daddy Yankee, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, composer, and actor. Known as the ""King of Reggaetón"" by music critics and fans alike, he is the artist who coined the word reggaeton in 1991 in the mixtape Playero 34 in the song ""So persigueme, no te detengas"" to describe the new music genre that was emerging from Puerto Rico that synthesized American hip-hop, Hispanic Caribbean music, and Jamaican reggae rhythms with Spanish rapping and singing. He is often cited as an influence by other Hispanic urban performers. Ayala was born in Río Piedras and was raised in the Villa Kennedy Housing Projects neighborhood. He aspired to be a professional baseball player and tried out for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. Before he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a studio recording session with reggaeton artist DJ Playero. Ayala spent roughly a year and a half recovering from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing him to focus entirely on a music career. In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his international hit single ""Gasolina"", which is credited with introducing reggaeton to audiences worldwide, and making the music genre a global phenomenon. Since then, he has sold around 30 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. Daddy Yankee's album Barrio Fino made history when it became the top-selling Latin music album of the decade between 2000 and 2009. In 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the hit single ""Despacito"". It became the first Spanish-language song to hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 since ""Macarena"" in 1996. The single gained global success. The video for ""Despacito"" on YouTube received its billionth view on April 20, 2017, and became the most-watched video on the platform. Its success led Daddy Yankee to become the most-listened artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify in June 2017, the first Latin artist to do so. In March 2022, Daddy Yankee announced that he would be retiring from music after the release of his upcoming seventh studio album Legendaddy and its supporting tour. As of March 2022, Daddy Yankee has won 184 awards from 484 nominations (see List of awards and nominations received by Daddy Yankee). He has won five Latin Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, 14 Billboard Latin Music Awards, two Latin American Music Awards, eight Lo Nuestro Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and six ASCAP Awards. He also received a Puerto Rican Walk of Fame star, special awards by People en Español magazine, and the Presencia Latina at Harvard University. He was named by CNN as the ""Most Influential Hispanic Artist"" of 2009, and included in Time 100 in 2006.";"The evidence provided is insufficient to support the claim that Daddy Yankee is an audio engineer. 

While the snippets from DBpedia provide a detailed overview of Daddy Yankee's career as a rapper, singer, composer, and actor, they do not mention any qualifications or roles related to audio engineering. The snippets focus on his contributions to the music industry, particularly in the reggaeton genre, and highlight his achievements and influence, but they do not indicate that he has the specific occupation of an audio engineer.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence, as there is no direct reference to Daddy Yankee being an audio engineer in the provided information.";;
110;Saint Peter was the founder of churches.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Saint_Peter → abstract → Saint Peter (died between AD 64 and 68), also known as Peter the Apostle, Peter the Rock, Simon Peter, Simeon, Simon, or Cephas, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, and one of the first leaders of the early Christian Church. He is traditionally counted as the first bishop of Rome‍—‌or pope‍—‌and also as the first bishop of Antioch. Based on contemporary historical data, his papacy is estimated to have spanned from AD 30 to his death, which would make him the longest-reigning pope, at anywhere from 34 to 38 years; however, the length of his reign has never been verified. According to Christian tradition, Peter was crucified in Rome under Emperor Nero. The ancient Christian churches all venerate Peter as a major saint and as the founder of the Church of Antioch and the Church of Rome, but differ in their attitudes regarding the authority of his successors. According to Catholic teaching, Jesus promised Peter a special position in the Church. In the New Testament, the name ""Simon Peter"" is found 19 times. He appears repeatedly and prominently in all four gospels as well as the Acts of the Apostles. He is the brother of Saint Andrew, and both were fishermen. The Gospel of Mark in particular was traditionally thought to show the influence of Peter's preaching and eyewitness memories. He is also mentioned, under either the name Peter or Cephas, in Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians and the Epistle to the Galatians. The New Testament also includes two general epistles, First Peter and Second Peter, that are traditionally attributed to him, but modern scholarship generally rejects the Petrine authorship of both. Nevertheless, Evangelicals and Catholics have always affirmed Peter's authorship, and recently, a growing number of scholars have revived the claim of Petrine authorship of these epistles. Outside of the New Testament, several apocryphal books were later attributed to him, in particular the Acts of Peter, Gospel of Peter, Preaching of Peter, Apocalypse of Peter, and Judgment of Peter, although scholars believe these works to be pseudoepigrapha.

The evidence also notes that he is venerated by ancient Christian churches, further reinforcing his status as a founder.

Additionally, the second snippet directly links Saint Peter to the founding of the Catholic Church in Lebanon, which is another indication of his foundational role in the broader context of Christianity.

The film stars Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Rooney Mara, David Wenham, and Nicole Kidman, as well as Abhishek Bharate, Divian Ladwa, Priyanka Bose, Deepti Naval, Tannishtha Chatterjee, and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. It tells the true story of how Brierley, 25 years after being separated from his family in India, sets out to find them. It is a joint production between Australia and the United Kingdom. The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2016, was given a limited release in North America on 25 November 2016, by The Weinstein Company before opening generally on 6 January 2017. It was released in Australia on 19 January 2017 and in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2017. Lion was well-received by critics, with praise for the acting (particularly from Patel and Kidman), emotional weight, visuals, cinematography and screenplay; it received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Patel), Best Supporting Actress (Kidman), and Best Adapted Screenplay. It won two BAFTA Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Patel) and Best Adapted Screenplay.

... (88 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that ""Rogue is a comic book character who kills others with her touch"" is mixed, with some evidence supporting the claim and other evidence contradicting it.

1. **Supporting Evidence**: 
   - Several snippets indicate that Rogue's powers can be lethal. For example, one source states, ""Rogue can't touch another human being without harming or even killing them,"" which directly supports the claim. Another snippet mentions that Rogue has the ""unfortunate superpower of killing"" when she touches others, further reinforcing the idea that her touch can be deadly.

2. **Contradicting Evidence**: 
   - However, there are also multiple pieces of evidence that contradict the claim. For instance, one snippet states that Rogue's ability typically renders others unconscious rather than killing them. Another source mentions that her powers can absorb life force but do not always result in death, indicating that while her touch can be dangerous, it does not always lead to fatal outcomes.

3. **Neutral Evidence**: 
   - Many snippets provide neutral information about Rogue's powers, discussing her ability to absorb powers and memories through touch without explicitly stating that this results in death. This suggests that while her powers can be harmful, they are not exclusively lethal.

In conclusion, the evidence is **insufficient** to definitively support the claim that Rogue kills others with her touch, as it presents a nuanced view of her abilities. While her touch can be lethal, it is not always the case, and her powers often incapacitate rather than kill. Therefore, the claim is partially true but lacks the clarity needed to be fully supported.";;

By January 2009, the single had sold over one million copies in the UK alone, a first for a British female soloist. In 2009, Burke released her debut album, Overcome, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spawned four number-one singles on the UK Singles Chart and the Irish Singles Chart—""Hallelujah"", ""Bad Boys"", ""All Night Long"" and ""Start Without You""—and the album became one of the most successful albums of that year in the UK. The singles released from the album earned her three BRIT Award nominations. The album saw the release of UK top 10 hit, ""Broken Heels"" and ""The Silence"". ""Elephant"" was released as Burke's comeback single in February 2012, and ""Let It Go"" served as the second single and Burke's second album, Heartbreak on Hold, was released in June 2012. In June 2014, Burke replaced Beverley Knight in the lead role of Rachel Marron in the West End musical The Bodyguard, at the Adelphi Theatre, touring with the production in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019.

The Meyerowitz Stories was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section and also won the Palm Dog award at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Baumbach's script and direction as well as the performances, with Sandler especially singled out for praise. It was released in theaters and on streaming by Netflix on October 13, 2017. The film was the second Netflix film competing at Cannes, along with Okja, which caused a clash with the jury president Pedro Almodóvar, who sided with the opinion that Cannes Film Festival films should be made for big screens, not online streaming. In 2017, the Cannes Film Festival announced a new rule, which requires a film competing at Cannes to ""commit itself to being distributed in French movie theatres"". A French law mandates that films cannot be shown on streaming services for 36 months after their theatrical release, effectively blocking Netflix films from future festivals.

He is best known for his radio show, The Howard Stern Show, which gained popularity when it was nationally syndicated on terrestrial radio from 1986 to 2005. He has broadcast on Sirius XM Satellite Radio since 2006. Stern landed his first radio jobs while at Boston University. From 1976 to 1982, he developed his on-air personality through morning positions at WRNW in Briarcliff Manor, New York; WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut; WWWW in Detroit, Michigan; and WWDC in Washington, D.C. He worked afternoons at WNBC in New York City from 1982 until his firing in 1985. In 1985, he began a 20-year run at WXRK in New York City; his morning show entered syndication in 1986 and aired in 60 markets and attracted 20 million listeners at its peak. In recent years, Stern's photography has been featured in Hamptons and WHIRL magazines. From 2012 to 2015, he served as a judge on America's Got Talent. Stern has won numerous industry awards, including Billboard's Nationally Syndicated Air Personality of the Year eight consecutive times, and he is the first to have the number one morning show in New York City and Los Angeles simultaneously. He became the most fined radio host when the Federal Communications Commission issued fines totaling $2.5 million to station owners for content it deemed indecent. Stern became one of the highest-paid radio figures after signing a five-year deal with Sirius in 2004 worth $500 million. Stern has described himself as the ""King of All Media"" since 1992 for his successes outside radio. He hosted and produced numerous late-night television shows, pay-per-view events, and home videos. Two of his books, Private Parts (1993) and Miss America (1995), entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number one and sold over one million copies. The former was made into a biographical comedy film in 1997 that had Stern and his radio show staff star as themselves. It topped the US box office in its opening week and grossed $41.2 million domestically. Stern performs on its soundtrack, which charted the Billboard 200 at number one and was certified platinum for one million copies sold.

The key points from the evidence include:

1. The evidence states that Howard Stern's radio show gained popularity when it was nationally syndicated on terrestrial radio starting in 1986 and continued until 2005. This indicates that the show was indeed nationally syndicated during that time frame.

2. Although the evidence specifies the end of the terrestrial syndication in 2005, it does not explicitly confirm the continuation of the show on terrestrial radio until 2008. However, it is important to note that the claim does not assert that the show was still being broadcast on terrestrial radio in 2008, but rather that it was syndicated during the period from 1986 to 2008. 

3. The evidence also mentions that Stern began broadcasting on Sirius XM Satellite Radio in 2006, which aligns with the timeline of his transition from terrestrial radio.

Overall, while the evidence does not confirm the exact end date of terrestrial syndication as 2008, it sufficiently supports the claim that the show was nationally syndicated from 1986 to 2005, and the phrasing of the claim does not contradict the evidence provided. Therefore, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim.";;

... (73 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence provided is insufficient to clearly support or refute the claim that ""Ford Motor Company is the fifth-largest maker of Belgian cars in the world."" 

Here's why:

1. **Lack of Specificity**: The evidence primarily discusses Ford's global ranking as an automaker, stating that it is the fifth-largest in the world based on various metrics (e.g., sales, revenue). However, it does not specifically address Ford's ranking in the context of Belgian car manufacturing or its production in Belgium.

2. **Neutral Statements**: Most of the evidence snippets are labeled as ""neutral,"" indicating that they do not provide a definitive answer regarding Ford's position specifically in Belgium. They mention Ford's operations in Belgium but do not quantify its production or sales relative to other Belgian car manufacturers.

3. **Contradictory Information**: Some snippets suggest that Ford is not the fifth-largest in Belgium, with one stating that Ford is the sixth-largest globally. This inconsistency further complicates the ability to confirm the claim.

4. **Focus on Global Context**: The evidence focuses on Ford's global standing rather than its specific performance in the Belgian market, which is crucial for validating the claim.

In summary, while Ford is recognized as a significant player in the global automotive industry, the evidence does not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny its status as the fifth-largest maker of Belgian cars specifically.";;
126;The animated film The Incredibles was adapted from a comic book series.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. The_Incredibles → abstract → The Incredibles is a 2004 American computer-animated superhero film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Written and directed by Brad Bird, it stars the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Jason Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Elizabeth Peña. Set in a retro-futuristic version of the 1960s, the film follows Bob and Helen Parr, a couple of superheroes, known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, who hide their powers in accordance with a government mandate, and attempt to live a quiet suburban life with their three children. However, Bob's desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe. Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after Warner Bros.' box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film's orchestral score. The Incredibles debuted at the El Capitan Theatre on October 24, 2004, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5. It earned $632 million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004. The Incredibles received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for its animation, screenplay, action sequences, humor, voice acting, themes, music, and appeal to different age groups, and is frequently considered to be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. It won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Sound Editing with two additional nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing, as well as winning the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. A sequel, Incredibles 2, was released in June 2018.

  1. The_Incredibles → quote → The Incredibles was everything that computer-generated animation had trouble doing. It had human characters, it had hair, it had water, it had fire, it had a massive number of sets. The creative heads were excited about the idea of the film, but once I showed story reels of exactly what I wanted, the technical teams turned white. They took one look and thought, “This will take ten years and cost $500 million. How are we possibly going to do this?”

So I said, “Give us the black sheep. I want artists who are frustrated. I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody's listening to. Give us all the guys who are probably headed out the door.” A lot of them were malcontents because they saw different ways of doing things, but there was little opportunity to try them, since the established way was working very, very well.

We gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories, and we changed the way a number of things are done here. For less money per minute than was spent on the previous film, Finding Nemo, we did a movie that had three times the number of sets and had everything that was hard to do. All this because the heads of Pixar gave us leave to try crazy ideas.";"The evidence provided does not support the claim that ""The Incredibles was adapted from a comic book series."" Instead, it indicates that the film was developed by Brad Bird as an extension of the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. This suggests that while the film may have been inspired by comic book themes and aesthetics, it was not directly adapted from an existing comic book series.

Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to support the claim, as it does not confirm that The Incredibles is based on a specific comic book series, but rather that it draws inspiration from the genre and era of comic books.";;

128;Adolf Hitler retired after the French World Fair in Paris.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Adolf_Hitler → abstract → Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadoːlf ˈhɪt.lɐ]; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was dictator of Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust: the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims. Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (""My Struggle""). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. The former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died and Hitler replaced him as the head of state and government. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support. Hitler sought Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. In December 1941, he declared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned as Hitler had commanded. The historian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes Hitler as ""the embodiment of modern political evil"". Under Hitler's leadership and racist ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.

It was developed by Cyril Callister in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1922. A spread for sandwiches, toast, crumpets and cracker biscuits as well as a filling for pastries, Vegemite is similar to British Marmite, New Zealand Marmite, Australian Promite, MightyMite, AussieMite, OzEmite, German Vitam-R, and Swiss Cenovis. Vegemite is salty, slightly bitter, malty, and rich in glutamates – giving it an umami flavour similar to beef bouillon. It is vegan, kosher, and halal.

131;Afghanistan is the source of the Ghorid Kingdom.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Afghanistan → abstract → Afghanistan, officially the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located at the crossroads of Central Asia and South Asia. Referred to as the Heart of Asia, it is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan to the northwest, Uzbekistan to the north, Tajikistan to the northeast, and China to the northeast and east. Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi) of land, the country is predominantly mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest, which are separated by the Hindu Kush mountain range. As of 2021, its population is 40.2 million (officially estimated to be 32.9 million), composed mostly of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. Kabul is the country's largest city and serves as its capital. Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic era, and the country's strategic location along the historic Silk Road has led it to being described, picturesquely, as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’. Popularly referred to as the graveyard of empires, the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Maurya Empire, Arab Muslims, the Mongols, the British, the Soviet Union, and most recently by an American-led coalition. Afghanistan also served as the source from which the Greco-Bactrians and the Mughals, among others, rose to form major empires. The various conquests and periods in both the Iranian and Indian cultural spheres made the area a center for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and later Islam throughout history. The modern state of Afghanistan began with the Durrani dynasty in the 18th century, with the Durrani Afghan Empire being formed by Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Durrani Empire led conquests in which, at its peak, encompassed land that spanned from eastern Iran to northern India. Following its decline and the death of Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Timur Shah, it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms, including but not limited to: Herat, Kandahar and Kabul. Afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after wars of unification led by Dost Mohammad Khan, where he conquered the independent principalities in Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad died in 1863, weeks after his last campaign to unite Afghanistan, and as a result, threw Afghanistan back into civil war with his successors. During this time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Empire (in British-ruled India) and the Russian Empire. From India, the British attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but were repelled in the First Anglo-Afghan War. However, the Second Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory and the successful establishment of British political influence over Afghanistan. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign dominance, and eventually emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under Amanullah Khan. This monarchy lasted almost 50 years, until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973, following which the Republic of Afghanistan was established. Since the late 1970s, Afghanistan's history has been dominated by extensive warfare, including coups, invasions, insurgencies, and civil wars which would end twice with the victory of the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban. In 1979 the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Mujahideen fought against them in the Soviet–Afghan War and continued fighting amongst themselves following Soviet withdrawal in 1989. The Taliban controlled most of the country by 1996, but their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan received little international recognition before its overthrow in the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan. The Taliban returned to power in 2021 following Kabul's capture by the Taliban and the concurrent overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, ending the 2001–2021 war. Although initially claiming to form an inclusive government for the country, the Taliban in September 2021 re-established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with an interim government made up entirely of Taliban members; the regime currently remains internationally unrecognized. Afghanistan is prominently rich in natural resources, including lithium, iron, zinc, and copper, amongst many others. It is also the world's largest producer of opium, second largest producer of cannabis, and third largest of both saffron and cashmere. The country is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and a founding member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Due to the effects of war in recent decades, the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism, poverty, and child malnutrition. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th-largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.

  1. Muhammad_of_Ghor → abstract → Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad ibn Sam (Persian: معز الدین محمد بن سام), also Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori, also Ghūri (Persian: معز الدین محمد غوری) (1144 – March 15, 1206), commonly known as Muhammad of Ghor, also Ghūr, or Muhammad Ghori, also Ghūri, was a ruler from the Ghurid dynasty based in what is today Afghanistan who ruled from 1173 CE to 1206 CE. He extended the Ghurid dominions eastwards and laid the foundation of Islamic rule in the Indian Subcontinent, which lasted after him for nearly half a millennium. During his joint reign with his brother Ghiyasuddin Ghori (r. c. 1163–1203), the Ghurids reached the epogee of their territorial expansion. During his early military career as a prince and governor of the southern tract of the Ghurid Empire, Muhammad subjugated the Oghuz tribe after multiple raids and captured Ghazna where he was crowned by his brother Ghiyasuddin Ghori, who was ruling from his capital Firozkoh since 1163. Muhammad of Ghor crossed the Indus River in 1175, approaching it through Gomal Pass and captured Multan and Uch from the Qarmatīa rulers within a year. Afterwards, Muhammad marched via Multan and Uch into present-day Gujarat in 1178, where his forces were routed at the foot of Mount Abu in the southern Aravali ranges by a coalition of Rajput chiefs led by Mularaja Solanki of Anhilwara, which forced him to change his route for future inroads into India. Hence, Muhammad of Ghor pressed upon the Ghaznawids, and uprooted them by 1186, conquering the upper Indus Plain along with most of the Punjab. After consolidating his hold in northwest, Muhammad of Ghor, penetrated through the traditional route of Khyber Pass into northern India. In 1191, his forces were defeated by a Rajput Confederacy led by Prithviraj Chauhan near Tarain. However, in 1192, Muhammad of Ghor returned with a vast army of Turkish mounted archers and secured a decisive victory on the same battleground and executed Prithviraj shortly afterwards. His victory at Tarain marked a watershed in medieval history of India. He concentrated thereafter on expansion in the west along with raiding in northern India from his base in Ghazna and left his conquests in India to his slave generals who swiftly raided local kingdoms and expanded the influence of the Ghurids until Bengal in the east. After the death of his brother in 1203, Muhammad of Ghor ascended the throne of Fīrōzkōh as well. Within a year or so in conflict with the Khwarazmian Empire, he suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Andkhud against the Qara-Khitai forces (came in as aid of Khwarazmian Empire) led by Tayangu which halted his expansion in Central Asia and resulted in the loss of Merv and most of the Khorasan. Muhammad of Ghor suppressed the rebels which arose after the defeat and built a boat bridge across the Oxus to launch a full-scale invasion of Transoxiana to avenge his defeat, although a rebellion by the Khokhars forced him to move towards Punjab, where he brutually crushed the Khokhar revolt during his last campaign. On his way back, Muhammad of Ghor was assassinated on the bank of Indus at Damyak on 15 March 1206, by a group of assassins from the rival Ismāʿīlīyah sect while offering the evening prayer. After his death, his empire fragmented amidst the rise of Khwarazmian Empire under Muhammad II of Khwarezm who overthrew the Ghurids by 1215. His conquests in the Indian Subcontinent, although continued to thrive under the Mamlūk dynasty established by his slave commander Qutb ud-Din Aibak.

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that ""Elizabeth Banks is a singer"" is mixed, with both supporting and contradicting information present.

1. **Supporting Evidence**: 
   - Several snippets suggest that Elizabeth Banks is recognized as a singer. For example, one snippet states, ""Elizabeth Banks: She is a great singer,"" and another mentions her involvement in songs from the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise, indicating she has performed musically. Additionally, there are references to her having songs listed on music platforms, which implies she has a musical presence.

2. **Contradicting Evidence**: 
   - A significant amount of evidence contradicts the claim, emphasizing her primary roles as an actress, director, and producer. Many snippets describe her as an ""American actress, director, and producer,"" with no mention of her being a singer. This suggests that while she may have sung in specific contexts (like in movies), her main career focus is not as a singer.

3. **Insufficient Evidence**: 
   - The evidence does not provide a clear consensus. While there are claims of her being a singer, they are often tied to her roles in films rather than a standalone music career. The snippets that highlight her singing abilities often come from contexts where she is primarily recognized for her acting.

In conclusion, the evidence is **insufficient** to definitively support the claim that Elizabeth Banks is a singer in the traditional sense. While she has demonstrated singing ability in specific roles, her primary identity remains that of an actress and filmmaker.";;
133;Nike, Inc.'s trademarks are a dog and the Swoosh logo.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Swoosh → abstract → The Swoosh is the logo of American sportswear designer and retailer Nike. Today, it has become one of the most recognizable brand logos in the world, and the most valuable, having a worth of $26 billion alone. Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight founded Nike on January 25, 1964, as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS). Upon changing its name to Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971, the company adopted the Swoosh as its official logo the same year. Carolyn Davidson, a student at Portland State University during the time Knight taught there, created the logo, attempting to convey motion in its design. The logo has undergone minor changes from its original design in 1971, today most commonly seen as a solo swoosh, although for much of its history, the logo incorporated the NIKE name alongside the Swoosh. Over the years, the orange and white color palette has traditionally been used on the logo, although most recently a solid black swoosh has gained significant popularity. The Swoosh has appeared alongside the trademark ""Just Do It"" since 1988. Together, these two make up the core of Nike's brand, and has been the face of the company, with many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the world sporting the logos.

  1. Nike,_Inc. → abstract → Nike, Inc. (/ˈnaɪki/ or /ˈnaɪk/) is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. The company is headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area. It is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in excess of US$37.4 billion in its fiscal year 2020 (ending May 31, 2020). As of 2020, it employed 76,700 people worldwide. In 2020, the brand alone was valued in excess of $32 billion, making it the most valuable brand among sports businesses. Previously, in 2017, the Nike brand was valued at $29.6 billion. Nike ranked 89th in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as ""Blue Ribbon Sports"", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well as Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Air Jordan, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, Nike CR7, and subsidiaries including Jordan Brand and Converse. Nike also owned Bauer Hockey from 1995 to 2008, and previously owned Cole Haan, Umbro, and Hurley International. In addition to manufacturing sportswear and equipment, the company operates retail stores under the Niketown name. Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the world, with the highly recognized trademarks of ""Just Do It"" and the Swoosh logo.

[Path 3]
  1. Nike,_Inc. → logo → Logo NIKE.svg";"The evidence provided is sufficient to support the claim that Nike, Inc.'s trademarks include the Swoosh logo. The snippets clearly state that the Swoosh is the official logo of Nike and is one of the most recognizable and valuable brand logos in the world. Additionally, the evidence mentions that the Swoosh logo, along with the trademark phrase ""Just Do It,"" forms the core of Nike's brand identity.

However, the claim that Nike's trademarks include ""a dog"" is not supported by the evidence. There is no mention of a dog being a trademark of Nike in any of the snippets provided. Therefore, while the evidence supports the existence of the Swoosh logo as a trademark, it does not support the claim regarding a dog.

In summary, the evidence is sufficient to confirm the existence of the Swoosh logo as a trademark of Nike, but it is insufficient to support the claim that a dog is also a trademark of Nike.";;
134;Friday the 13th is not owned by New Line Cinema.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;"[Path 1]
  1. Friday_the_13th_(2009_film) → abstract → Friday the 13th is a 2009 American slasher film directed by Marcus Nispel, written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift from a screen story by Shannon, Swift and Mark Wheaton. It is a reboot of the Friday the 13th franchise, which began in 1980, and is the twelfth installment. Nispel also directed the 2003 remake of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), while Shannon and Swift wrote the screenplay for the 2003 crossover Freddy vs. Jason. The film was produced by Platinum Dunes and Crystal Lake Entertainment and distributed by New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures. It stars Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Aaron Yoo, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle, and Derek Mears and follows Clay Miller (Padalecki) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney (Righetti), who is captured by Jason Voorhees (Mears) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake. The film was originally conceived as an origin story, but the project evolved into a re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status. Friday the 13th was theatrically released in the United States on February 13, 2009, by New Line Cinema in North American territories and by Paramount Pictures internationally. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that it did not add anything new to the franchise. The film would go on to gross $92.7 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million, becoming the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise after Freddy vs. Jason.

The snippets indicate that the 2009 film ""Friday the 13th"" was distributed by New Line Cinema, which is a clear indication of their involvement with the franchise. Additionally, the evidence mentions that New Line Cinema is listed as the studio for the film, further supporting the assertion that they have ownership or rights related to the franchise. 

Since the claim asserts that New Line Cinema does not own the franchise, and the evidence directly contradicts this by showing their role in the production and distribution of the film, we can conclude that the claim is false.";;

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that ""Adam Sandler voice acted in his car"" is insufficient to clearly support or refute the claim. 

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Several pieces of evidence contradict the claim. For instance, there are multiple snippets indicating that Adam Sandler was seen getting out of his car or involved in activities unrelated to voice acting while in a car. These include references to him washing a car, interacting with fans from his car, and other activities that do not support the idea of him voice acting while in a car.

2. **Neutral Evidence**: There are also several neutral snippets that mention Adam Sandler's voice acting roles in general but do not specifically address the context of him voice acting in a car. For example, references to his roles in animated films or discussions about his voice work do not confirm that he did so while in a car.

3. **Lack of Direct Evidence**: There is no direct evidence provided that explicitly states or implies that Adam Sandler performed voice acting while inside a car. The snippets mostly discuss his voice acting in various films or his activities related to cars, but none confirm the specific scenario of voice acting in a car.

In conclusion, the evidence does not provide a clear answer to the claim, as it contains contradictions and lacks direct support for the specific scenario described.";;
136;Event management includes arranging lecturers.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Event_management → abstract → Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of small and/or large-scale personal or corporate events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions. It involves studying the brand, identifying its target audience, devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event. The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the Olympics down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, celebrities, charitable organizations, and interest groups hold events in order to market their label, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement. The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as event planning and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary permits, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, catering, coordinating with third-party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning and execution of each event differs on basis of the type of event. The event manager is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements. This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, audio-visual production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service. Due to the complexities involved, the extensive body of knowledge required, and the rapidly changing environment, event management is frequently cited as one of the most stressful career paths, in line next to surgeons.

Therefore, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim, as it directly addresses the role of arranging speakers, which includes lecturers, in the context of event management.";;

  1. Amazon_(company) → abstract → Amazon.com, Inc. (/ˈæməzɒn/ AM-ə-zon) is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It has been referred to as ""one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world"", and is one of the world's most valuable brands. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker The Everything Store. It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4 billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer. Amazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and ""aggressive"" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures. As of 2021, it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS, live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share. In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has over 200 million subscribers worldwide. It is the second-largest private employer in the United States. Amazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon Studios, and has been the owner of film and television studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics—most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs. Amazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices, a toxic work culture, tax avoidance, and anti-competitive behavior.

  1. Walmart → abstract → Walmart Inc. ( /ˈwɔːlmɑːrt/; formerly Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.) is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets (also called supercenters), discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in nearby Rogers, Arkansas in 1962 and incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law on October 31, 1969. It also owns and operates Sam's Club retail warehouses. As of October 31, 2022, Walmart has 10,586 stores and clubs in 24 countries, operating under 46 different names. The company operates under the name Walmart in the United States and Canada, as Walmart de México y Centroamérica in Mexico and Central America, and as Flipkart Wholesale in India. It has wholly owned operations in Chile, Canada, and South Africa. Since August 2018, Walmart held only a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big in August 2019, with 20 percent of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80 percent ownership of the company. They eventually divested their shareholdings in Grupo Big to French retailer Carrefour, in transaction worth R$7 billion and completed on June 7, 2022. Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, with about US$570 billion in annual revenue, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in May 2022. It is also the largest private employer in the world with 2.2 million employees. It is a publicly traded family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family. Sam Walton's heirs own over 50 percent of Walmart through both their holding company Walton Enterprises and their individual holdings. Walmart was the largest United States grocery retailer in 2019, and 65 percent of Walmart's US$510.329 billion sales came from U.S. operations. Walmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S., and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989. The company was originally geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s. Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989, and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, in July 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania, opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast. Walmart's investments outside the U.S. have seen mixed results. Its operations and subsidiaries in Canada, the United Kingdom (ASDA), Central America, South America, and China are successful, but its ventures failed in Germany, Japan, and South Korea.

1. **Market Position**: The evidence states that as of 2021, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China. This indicates that in terms of market value and influence, Amazon has taken a leading position over Walmart.

2. **Revenue Comparison**: While Walmart is noted as the world's largest company by revenue with about $570 billion in annual revenue, the context of the claim focuses on the overall value and market position rather than just revenue figures. Amazon's growth and expansion into various sectors (e-commerce, cloud computing, etc.) have contributed to its valuation and market influence, which is highlighted in the evidence.

3. **Brand Value and Influence**: The evidence describes Amazon as ""one of the most valuable brands"" and a significant economic force, which further supports the claim that it holds a higher value compared to Walmart.

In summary, the evidence clearly indicates that Amazon has a more significant market position and brand value than Walmart, thus supporting the claim that Walmart is a less valuable retailer than Amazon.";;

  1. Dunkirk_(2017_film) → abstract → Dunkirk is a 2017 war film written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan that depicts the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II through the perspectives of the land, sea and air. It is produced by Syncopy Inc. and distributed by Warner Bros. Its ensemble cast includes Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles in his film debut, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy. Dunkirk portrays the evacuation with little dialogue, as Christopher Nolan sought instead to create suspense from cinematography and music. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk and ended that September in Los Angeles, when post-production began. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film stock. Dunkirk has extensive practical effects, and employed thousands of extras as well as historic boats from the evacuation, and period aeroplanes. Distributed by Warner Bros., the film premiered on 13 July 2017 at Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was released in the United Kingdom and United States on 21 July. It is the highest-grossing World War II film, making $527 million worldwide. Dunkirk received praise for its screenplay, direction, musical score, sound effects and cinematography; some critics called it Nolan's best work, and one of the greatest war films. The film received various accolades, including eight nominations at the 90th Academy Awards: Best Picture and Best Director (Nolan's first directing Oscar nomination); it went on to win for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing.

His works are noted by music critics for featuring avant-garde styles and introspective, elliptical lyrics. Ocean has won two Grammy Awards and a Brit Award for International Male Solo Artist among other accolades, and his two studio albums have been listed on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2020). Ocean began his musical career as a ghostwriter, prior to joining the hip hop collective Odd Future in 2010.

First released in 2011, it became the world's largest standalone mobile app in 2018, with over 1 billion monthly active users. WeChat has been described as China's ""app for everything"" and a super-app because of its wide range of functions. WeChat provides text messaging, hold-to-talk voice messaging, broadcast (one-to-many) messaging, video conferencing, video games, sharing of photographs and videos and location sharing. User activity on WeChat is analyzed, tracked and shared with Chinese authorities upon request as part of the mass surveillance network in China. WeChat censors politically sensitive topics in China. Data transmitted by accounts registered outside China is surveilled, analyzed and used to build up censorship algorithms in China. In response to a border dispute between India and China, WeChat was banned in India in June 2020 along with several other Chinese apps. U.S. President Donald Trump sought to ban U.S. ""transactions"" with WeChat through an executive order but was blocked by a preliminary injunction issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in September 2020.

141;Walt Whitman was a volunteer doctor.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Supported;"[Path 1]
  1. Walt_Whitman → abstract → Walter Whitman (/ˈhwɪtmən/; May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work was controversial in his time, particularly his 1855 poetry collection Leaves of Grass, which was described as obscene for its overt sensuality. Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman resided in Brooklyn as a child and through much of his career. At the age of 11, he left formal schooling to go to work. Later, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, and a government clerk. Whitman's major poetry collection, Leaves of Grass, was first published in 1855 with his own money and became well known. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. During the American Civil War, he went to Washington, D.C. and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded. His poetry often focused on both loss and healing. On the death of Abraham Lincoln, whom Whitman greatly admired, he wrote his well known poems, ""O Captain! My Captain!"" and ""When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd"", and gave a series of lectures. After a stroke towards the end of his life, Whitman moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at the age of 72, his funeral was a public event. Whitman's influence on poetry remains strong. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe argued: ""You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without Leaves of Grass ... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him."" Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman ""America's poet ... He is America.""

[Path 3]
  1. Walt_Whitman → occupation → essayist";"The evidence provided supports the claim that Walt Whitman was a volunteer doctor during the American Civil War. The snippet explicitly states that he ""went to Washington, D.C. and worked in hospitals caring for the wounded,"" which indicates that he volunteered his services in a medical capacity, even though he was primarily known as a poet, essayist, and journalist.

The evidence is sufficient because it directly addresses the claim by detailing Whitman's involvement in caring for wounded soldiers, which aligns with the role of a volunteer doctor. The context of his actions during the Civil War further reinforces the claim, as it highlights his commitment to helping others during a time of national crisis. 

In summary, the evidence clearly supports the claim that Walt Whitman was a volunteer doctor.";;

The majority of the snippets indicate that there is no connection between Oliver Reed and the fashion brand Versace, with many sources explicitly stating facts about Reed's career and lifestyle without mentioning any involvement with Versace.

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Multiple snippets (e.g., from Wikipedia and IMDb) confirm that Oliver Reed was an English actor known for his roles in films but do not mention any association with Versace. The snippets consistently highlight his film career and personal life, which do not intersect with the fashion brand.

2. **Insufficient Evidence for Claim**: While there are a few snippets that mention ""Versace"" in contexts that include the name ""Reed,"" they do not establish any direct connection between Oliver Reed and the fashion brand. For example, one snippet mentions ""Versace Men's Black Belt"" alongside ""Curse Of The Werewolf Linen Mexican Lobby Card Hammer Horror Oliver Reed,"" but this does not imply that Reed was involved with Versace.

3. **Overall Conclusion**: The evidence is sufficient to refute the claim that Oliver Reed was in Versace. The overwhelming majority of the evidence indicates that there is no known association between the actor and the fashion brand, leading to the conclusion that the claim is false.";;

He was the first British man to reach the singles semifinals of Wimbledon since Roger Taylor in the 1970s. Henman reached six major semifinals and won 15 career ATP Tour titles (eleven in singles and four in doubles), including the 2003 Paris Masters. He also earned a 40–14 win-loss record with the Great Britain Davis Cup team. Henman was the British No. 1 player in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005, at which point he was overtaken by Andy Murray. He reached a career-high ranking of world No. 4 three different times between July 2002 and October 2004. He is one of the most successful British players of the Open Era, winning $11,635,542 prize money. In the 2004 New Year Honours, he was appointed an OBE. Henman started playing tennis before the age of three, and began systematic training in the Slater Squad at eleven. After suffering a serious injury which affected him for the better part of two years, he began touring internationally as a junior and achieved some successes. He rose quickly up the ATP rankings, and by 1996 had reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. For most of his career, Henman was considered a grass court specialist, reaching four Wimbledon semifinals in the five years between 1998 and 2002. He became comfortable on clay and hard courts only later in his career, when in 2004 he reached the semifinals of both the French and US Opens. Henman retired from professional tennis in late 2007, but remains active on the ATP Champions Tour (a tour for former professional tennis players).

  1. Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn → abstract → The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Latin: Ordo Hermeticus Aurorae Aureae), more commonly the Golden Dawn (Aurora Aurea), was a secret society devoted to the study and practice of occult Hermeticism and metaphysics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Known as a magical order, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development. Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as Wicca and Thelema, were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism. The three founders, William Robert Woodman, William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell Mathers, were Freemasons. Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn. The Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation, similar to Masonic lodges; however, women were admitted on an equal basis with men. The ""Golden Dawn"" was the first of three Orders, although all three are often collectively referred to as the ""Golden Dawn"". The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the Hermetic Qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four classical elements, as well as the basics of astrology, tarot divination, and geomancy. The Second or Inner Order, the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis, taught magic, including scrying, astral travel, and alchemy. The Third Order was that of the Secret Chiefs, who were said to be highly skilled; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the Chiefs of the Second Order.

  1. Ginger_Baker → abstract → Peter Edward ""Ginger"" Baker (19 August 1939 – 6 October 2019) was an English drummer. His work in the 1960s and 1970s earned him the reputation of ""rock's first superstar drummer"", for a style that melded jazz and African rhythms and pioneered both jazz fusion and world music. Baker gained early fame as a member of Blues Incorporated and the Graham Bond Organisation, both times alongside bassist Jack Bruce, with whom Baker would often clash. In 1966, Baker and Bruce joined guitarist Eric Clapton to form Cream, which achieved worldwide success but lasted only until 1968, in part due to Baker's and Bruce's volatile relationship. After working with Clapton in the short-lived band Blind Faith and leading Ginger Baker's Air Force, Baker spent several years in the 1970s living and recording in Africa, often with Fela Kuti, in pursuit of his long-time interest in African music. Among Baker's other collaborations are his work with Gary Moore, Masters of Reality, Public Image Ltd, Hawkwind, Atomic Rooster, Bill Laswell, jazz bassist Charlie Haden, jazz guitarist Bill Frisell and Ginger Baker's Energy. Baker's drumming is regarded for its style, showmanship, and use of two bass drums instead of the conventional one. In his early days, he performed lengthy drum solos, most notably in the Cream song ""Toad"", one of the earliest recorded examples in rock music. Baker was an inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Cream in 1993, of the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2008, and of the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2016. Baker was noted for his eccentric, often self-destructive lifestyle, and he struggled with heroin addiction for many years. He was married four times and fathered three children.";"The evidence provided does not support the claim that Ginger Baker was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The snippets retrieved focus on the history and structure of the Golden Dawn and provide a brief overview of Ginger Baker's career as a drummer, but they do not mention any connection between Baker and the Golden Dawn.

Specifically, the evidence discusses the Golden Dawn's role in occult practices and its founders, but there is no indication that Ginger Baker was involved with this organization. The information about Baker primarily highlights his musical achievements and collaborations, with no reference to any involvement in occult societies or the Golden Dawn.

Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to support the claim, as it fails to establish any link between Ginger Baker and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.";;

After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure. The character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone in 2001 to Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.

  1. Brian_Eno → abstract → Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno RDI (/ˈiːnoʊ/; born Brian Peter George Eno, 15 May 1948) is a British musician, composer, record producer and visual artist best known for his contributions to ambient music and work in rock, pop and electronica. A self-described ""non-musician"", Eno has helped introduce unconventional concepts and approaches to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as its synthesiser player in 1971, recording two albums with the group before departing in 1973. Eno then released a number of solo pop albums beginning with Here Come the Warm Jets (1974) and, also in the mid-1970s, began exploring a minimalist direction on influential recordings such as Discreet Music (1975) and Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978), coining the term ""ambient music"" with the latter. Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp, Harmonia, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, David Byrne and Judy Nylon. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, alongside work with artists such as Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn. Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation. In 2019, Eno was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.
