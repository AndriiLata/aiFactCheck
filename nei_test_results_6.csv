... (84 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence clearly refutes the claim that Felicity Jones was nominated for a Grammy Award. All the evidence provided indicates that she has received nominations for Academy Awards (Oscars) for her performances in films, specifically mentioning her nomination for ""The Brutalist."" There is no mention of any Grammy nominations in the evidence, which focuses solely on her achievements in film rather than music. Therefore, the claim is unsupported and can be considered false based on the available evidence.";;

... (88 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence provided does not clearly support or refute the claim that ""Ford Motor Company is half as large as General Motors."" The snippets retrieved are primarily neutral in nature and do not provide specific quantitative comparisons of the sizes of the two companies, such as revenue, market capitalization, or production volume.

While some snippets mention comparisons between Ford and General Motors, they do not offer concrete data or metrics that would allow for a determination of whether Ford is indeed half the size of GM. The references to market share, performance, and stock comparisons do not directly address the claim regarding the relative size of the two companies.

Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to support or refute the claim. More specific financial data or metrics comparing the two companies directly would be needed to evaluate the accuracy of the claim.";;

While the evidence includes various snippets about R. Madhavan's recent projects and comments, none of the snippets explicitly mention ""3 Kingdoms"" or confirm his involvement in that specific production. The snippets primarily discuss his roles in other films and his opinions on educational content, but they do not provide any direct information regarding his participation in ""3 Kingdoms."" 

Therefore, without clear evidence linking R. Madhavan to the cast of ""3 Kingdoms,"" we cannot definitively support or refute the claim.";;
