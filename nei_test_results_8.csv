... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence clearly refutes the claim that Kaitlin Olson had minor roles in a baseball team. The majority of the evidence indicates that she is primarily known for her significant roles in television, particularly as Dee Reynolds in ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" and does not support the idea of her having minor roles related to a baseball team.

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Multiple snippets explicitly state that Kaitlin Olson is best known for her prominent roles in television series rather than any minor roles in a baseball context. For example, one snippet states, ""Kaitlin Olson is best known for her role as Deandra 'Sweet Dee' Reynolds in the FX comedy series 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,'"" which emphasizes her major role rather than any minor involvement in baseball.

2. **Contextual References**: The evidence includes references to her participation in events related to baseball, such as appearing at MLB games or being associated with baseball players, but these do not indicate that she had any acting roles or significant involvement with a baseball team.

3. **High Confidence in Contradiction**: The evidence snippets have high confidence levels (ranging from 0.82 to 0.99) indicating strong contradictions to the claim, reinforcing that the claim is not supported.

In summary, the evidence is sufficient to refute the claim, as it consistently highlights her major roles in television and does not substantiate any involvement in minor roles within a baseball team context.";;

... (90 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence regarding the claim that Frank Zappa was a classical composer is largely supportive, but it is mixed with some contradictory information. 

**Supporting Evidence:**
1. Multiple sources explicitly state that Zappa was a classical composer, highlighting his serious approach to writing classical compositions alongside his work as a pop artist (e.g., ""As well as being a pop recording artist, Frank Zappa was deeply serious about writing classical compositions."").
2. Several snippets mention that Zappa was influenced by classical music and composers, and that he composed complex classical works (e.g., ""Frank Zappa was a completely schooled musician who chose a particularly innovative way of composing. I definitely consider him a classical composer."").
3. There are references to Zappa's works being categorized as classical music and his contributions to the genre (e.g., ""Frank Zappa has a well-deserved reputation as a creative genius. A multi-talented, classically trained composer..."").

**Contradictory Evidence:**
1. Some sources suggest that while Zappa was influenced by classical music, he was primarily known for his work in rock and other genres, indicating that he may not fit neatly into the category of a classical composer (e.g., ""Frank Zappa was never shy about citing the influence of modern classical music on him, especially in its more avant-garde aspects..."").
2. Other snippets emphasize his eclectic style and the blending of genres, which complicates the classification of his work strictly as classical (e.g., ""His musical style was diverse, incorporating a wide range of styles such as Doowop, Jazz, R&B and classical modernism."").

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the evidence is sufficient to support the claim that Frank Zappa was a classical composer, as many sources affirm his contributions to classical music and his serious engagement with the genre. However, the presence of contradictory evidence suggests that his identity as a composer is multifaceted, encompassing various musical styles beyond classical. Thus, while he can be classified as a classical composer, it is important to recognize the broader context of his work across multiple genres.";;

... (89 additional evidence items were found but not shown)";"The evidence does not support the claim that ""David Bowie has a house called Lodger."" Instead, the evidence indicates that ""Lodger"" is the title of David Bowie's thirteenth studio album, released in 1979, and is part of his Berlin Trilogy. 

Several pieces of evidence explicitly contradict the claim:

1. **Contradictory Evidence**: Multiple snippets clarify that ""Lodger"" refers to an album, not a house. For example, one snippet states, ""Lodger is the thirteenth studio album by the English musician David Bowie,"" and another mentions, ""David Bowie's Lodger was supposed to be called Planned Accidents,"" further emphasizing that ""Lodger"" is an album title.

2. **Contextual Evidence**: Other snippets discuss Bowie's life during the time he created the album ""Lodger,"" including references to his living situation in Berlin, but none suggest that he owned a house named ""Lodger.""

3. **General Consensus**: The majority of the evidence points to ""Lodger"" being a significant work in Bowie's discography rather than a physical residence.

In conclusion, the evidence is sufficient to refute the claim, as it consistently identifies ""Lodger"" as an album rather than a house.";;

2. **Role Clarification**: The evidence consistently refers to her character and her involvement in the film as an actress, not as a narrator.
