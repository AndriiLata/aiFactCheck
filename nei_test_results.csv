1;Kurupt is a priest.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;[];"The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the claim that Kurupt is a priest. The lack of evidence does not confirm the claim's validity or its falsehood; it simply indicates that there is no information available to verify the claim. Therefore, without additional context or evidence, we cannot draw a definitive conclusion about Kurupt's status as a priest.";;
2;Elementary was written by Lucy Liu.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Refuted;[];"The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the claim that ""Elementary"" was written by Lucy Liu. The lack of evidence means there is no confirmation that she was involved in the writing of the show. In fact, Lucy Liu is known for her role as an actress in ""Elementary,"" but there is no indication that she contributed to the writing. Therefore, without specific evidence linking her to the writing of the show, we cannot definitively support or refute the claim.";;
3;Friday the 13th is a single film.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Error;[];"The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the claim. The claim that ""Friday the 13th is a single film"" is factually incorrect, as ""Friday the 13th"" is actually a franchise that includes multiple films, starting with the original released in 1980. The lack of evidence found does not provide clarity on the claim; it simply indicates that no information was available to address it. Therefore, further research or context is needed to accurately evaluate the claim.";;
4;Neil Patrick Harris wrote the pilot for Doogie Howser, M.D.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Error;[];The evidence is insufficient to support the claim that Neil Patrick Harris wrote the pilot for Doogie Howser, M.D. The claim attributes the writing of the pilot to Harris, who is primarily known as an actor in the role of Doogie Howser. However, the lack of evidence indicates that there is no information confirming that he was involved in the writing process. In fact, the pilot was written by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley, which directly refutes the claim. Therefore, the evidence does not support the claim and instead suggests that it is incorrect.;;
5;Macbeth is about a man who becomes an alien.;NOT ENOUGH INFO;Error;[];"The evidence is insufficient to support or refute the claim. The claim that ""Macbeth is about a man who becomes an alien"" is not supported by any evidence, as there is no indication in the text of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" that it involves aliens or extraterrestrial themes. The play is a tragedy that focuses on ambition, power, guilt, and the supernatural, primarily through the character of Macbeth, who is a Scottish nobleman. Therefore, the claim appears to be a misinterpretation or a fictional reinterpretation of the original work.";;
